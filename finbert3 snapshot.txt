We, Medallion Financial Corp. or the Company, are a finance company, organized as a Delaware corporation, that includes Medallion Bank, our
primary operating subsidiary. Effective April 2, 2018, following authorization by our shareholders, we withdrew our previous election to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, or the 1940 Act. Prior to such time, we were a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that had elected to be treated as a BDC
under the 1940 Act.  As a result of this change in status, commencing with the three months ended June 30, 2018: 
 
 

In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946  Financial Services  Investment Companies, we made this
change to our financial reporting prospectively, and did not restate or revise periods prior to our change in status to a non-investment company effective April 2, 2018. Accordingly, in this report we
refer to both accounting in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to bank holding companies (Bank Holding Company Accounting), which applies commencing April 2, 2018, and to that applicable to investment
companies under the 1940 Act (Investment Company Accounting), which applies to prior periods.

We historically have had a leading position in originating, acquiring, and servicing loans
that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial businesses. Recently, our strategic growth has been through Medallion Bank which originates consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats, and trailers and to finance
small-scale home improvements. Since Medallion Bank acquired a consumer loan portfolio and began originating consumer loans in 2004, it has increased its consumer loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 16% (19% if there had been no loan
sales during 2016, 2017, and 2018). In January 2017, we announced our plans to transform our overall strategy. We are transitioning away from medallion lending and placing our strategic focus on our growing consumer finance portfolio. Total assets
under management and management of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which includes our managed net investment portfolio, as well as assets serviced for third party investors and unconsolidated subsidiaries, were $1,522,000,000 as of December 31,
2018, and were $1,593,000,000 as of December 31, 2017, and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 9% from $215,000,000 at the end of 1996. Since our initial public offering in 1996, we have paid/declared distributions in excess of
$263,060,000, or $14.66 per share.  We conduct our business through various wholly-owned subsidiaries, including: 
 
 
 
 
 

Our other consolidated subsidiaries are comprised of Medallion Fine Art, Inc., Medallion Taxi Media, Inc.,
CDI-LP Holdings, Inc., Medallion Motorsports, LLC, and RPAC Racing, LLC, or RPAC. In addition, we make both marketable and nonmarketable equity investments, primarily as a function of our mezzanine
lending business.  Our Market  We
provide loans to individuals and small to mid-size businesses, through our subsidiaries, in four segments:   

 

 

 

The following chart shows the details of our loans receivable as of December 31, 2018: 
 

  4 





Consumer Loans 
Consumer loans are originated by the Bank and consist of loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats and trailers (recreation
lending) and to finance home improvements such as replacement windows and roofs (home improvement lending). Combined consumer loans outstanding were $761,541,000 at December 31, 2018 and comprised 77% of our net loans receivable compared to
$683,502,000 comprising 49% of our $1,380,054,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017. The managed net investment portfolio was all investments held by our consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries. We believe that the
consumer loan portfolio is of acceptable credit quality given the high interest rates earned on the loans, which compensate for the higher degree of credit risk in the loan portfolio. 
Recreation Lending. Recreation lending is a high-growth business focused on originating prime and
non-prime recreation loans. The segment is a significant source of income, accounting for 71.0% of our interest income for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. All of our recreation loans are serviced
by a third-party loan servicer, and we have used the same loan servicer since the businesss inception.  Through the Bank, we
maintain non-exclusive relationships with more than 2,800 dealers and financial service providers (FSPs), not all of which are active at any one time. FSPs are entities that provide finance and insurance
(F&I) services to small dealers that do not have the desire or ability to provide F&I services themselves. The ability of FSPs to aggregate the financing and relationship management for many small dealers makes them valuable to the Bank. We
receive approximately half of our loan volume from dealers and the other half from FSPs. A dedicated sales team working from the Banks Salt Lake City headquarters manages our relationships with dealers and FSPs. Approximately 4% of recreation
lendings new loan originations for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 were from our top ten dealer relationships and an additional 24% were from our top three FSP relationships. 
The recreation lending portfolio consists of thousands of geographically distributed loans with an average loan size of approximately $13,500
as of December 31, 2018. The loans are fixed rate loans with an average loan term at origination of approximately 10 years. The weighted average remaining term of our loans outstanding at
December 31, 2018 is 8.5 years. The size, geographic dispersion, source variety and collateral variety of the loans reduce risk to the Company. 
Home Improvement Lending. Through the Bank, we work directly with contractors and an FSP to offer flexible customer financing for
window, siding and roof replacement, swimming pool installation and solar system installation, and other home improvement projects. Our core product is a standard installment loan, which features affordable monthly payments and competitive interest
rates for prime credit customers at no cost to the contractor. We also offer a variety of promotional loan options to help contractors close a challenging sale. Promotional loan options include same-as-cash, no interest and deferred payment features, which allow borrowers to reduce the total cost of financing or start repayments when it is most convenient. 
Home improvement lending operates in a manner similar to recreation lending, with a few key differences. Through the Bank, we maintain a
smaller number of non-exclusive relationships; the Bank currently has relationships with approximately 600 contractors. Most of our home improvement-financed sales take place in the borrowers home
instead of a store, with the contractor presenting the borrower with a bid that includes a financing option.  A large proportion of our
home improvement-financed sales are facilitated by contractor salespeople with limited financing backgrounds rather than by contractor employees who provide F&I services. The result is contractor demand for financing services that facilitate an in-home transaction (e.g., information technology and extended operating hours) and additional support for the salesperson throughout the financing process. The Banks contractor relationships are managed by a
remote sales team with employees located in the geographical regions served. Approximately 59% of home improvement lendings new loan originations for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 were from our top ten contractors and our FSP
relationship.

We offer only fixed rate home improvement loans with an average loan term at origination of
approximately 12 years. The weighted average remaining term of our loans outstanding is 10.2 years as of December 31, 2018. The average size of the loans in our home improvement portfolio is approximately $14,100, and geographic dispersion,
source variety and collateral variety of home improvement loans reduce risk to the Company.  Commercial Loans 
Commercial loans finance either the purchase of the equipment and related assets necessary to open a new business or the purchase or
improvement of an existing business. From the inception of the commercial loan business in 1987 through December 31, 2018, we have originated more than $970,572,000 of commercial loans. Commercial loans of $64,083,000 comprised 7% of our net
loans receivable as of December 31, 2018, compared to managed commercial loans of $91,783,000, or 7%, of our $1,380,054,000 net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017. We have worked to increase our commercial loan activity in recent
years, primarily because of the attractive higher yielding nature of most of this business. The increase since 1996 has been primarily driven by internal growth through the origination of additional commercial loans. We focus our marketing efforts
on the manufacturing, professional, scientific, and technical services and other services. The majority of our commercial borrowers are located in the New York metropolitan area and the Midwest. We plan to continue expanding our commercial loan
activities by developing a more diverse borrower base, with a wider geographic area of coverage, and by expanding targeted industries. 
Mainly through our subsidiary Medallion Capital, we originate both senior and subordinated loans nationwide to businesses in a variety of
industries, including manufacturing and various service providers, more than 51% of which are located in the Midwest and Northeast regions, with the rest scattered across the country. These commercial loans are primarily secured by a second position
on all assets of the businesses and generally range in amount from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 at origination. As a component of most of the transactions, a portion of the investment is an equity or partnership stake, and occasionally, we also receive
warrants to purchase an equity interest in the borrowers or some other form of success fee or profit participation.  Commercial loans are
generally secured by equipment, accounts receivable, real estate, or other assets, and have interest rates averaging 806 basis points over the prevailing prime rate at the end of 2018, up from 735 basis points over prime at the end of 2017. 
Medallion Loans  Taxi medallion loans of
$155,863,000 comprised 16% of our net loans receivable as of December 31, 2018, compared to managed taxi medallion loans of $388,001,000, or 28%, of our $1,380,054,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017. Including
loans to unaffiliated investors and unconsolidated subsidiaries, the total amount of medallion loans under our management was $323,786,000 as of December 31, 2018, compared to $414,350,000 as of December 31, 2017. Since 1979, we have
originated approximately $3,631,000,000 in medallion loans in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Newark, Cambridge, and other cities within the United States. In addition, our management has a long history of owning, managing, and financing taxicab
fleets, taxicab medallions, and corporate car services, dating back to 1956.  Medallion loans collateralized by New York City taxicab
medallions and related assets comprised 87% and 73% (81% on a managed basis) of the medallion loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Based on taxi medallion values published by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, or TLC,
and our cash flow analysis, we estimate that the total value of all of New York City taxicab medallions and related assets such as the vehicle, taximeter, and roof lights exceeded $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. We estimate that the
total value of all taxicab medallions and related assets in our major US markets exceeded $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. 
While medallion loans do become delinquent or in default, all of our medallion loans are secured by the medallion and enhanced with personal
guarantees of the owners, shareholders or equity members. When a 
  6 






borrower defaults on a loan, we have the ability to restructure the underlying loan or repossess the medallion collateralizing that loan and sell it in the market or through a foreclosure auction
and pursue the personal guarantees, all of which we have done. Given the current market conditions, we have recorded an allowance for loan losses against performing and nonperforming loans to mitigate potential future losses. 
The New York City Market. A New York City taxicab medallion is the only permitted license to operate a taxicab and accept street hails
in New York City, except as discussed below. As reported by the TLC, individual (owner-driver) medallions and corporate medallions sold for a wide variety of prices during the year. Our analysis of transaction activity combined with cash flow
analysis of owners and operators supported our estimated value of $181,000, net of liquidation costs, as of December 31, 2018. The number of taxicab medallions is limited by law to 13,630 medallions outstanding as of December 31, 2018. A
New York State law permits cars for hire to pick up street hails in the boroughs outside Manhattan. Pursuant to such law, the TLC began issuing Street Hail Livery licenses in June 2013. 
A prospective medallion owner must qualify under the medallion ownership standards set and enforced by the TLC. These standards prohibit
individuals with criminal records from owning medallions, require that the funds used to purchase medallions be derived from legitimate sources, and mandate that taxicab vehicles and meters meet TLC specifications. In addition, before the TLC will
approve a medallion transfer, the TLC requires a letter from the sellers insurer stating that there are no outstanding claims for personal injuries in excess of insurance coverage. After the transfer is approved, the owners taxicab is
subject to quarterly TLC inspections.  Most New York City medallion transfers are handled through approximately 20 medallion brokers
licensed by the TLC. In addition to brokering medallions, these brokers also arrange for TLC documentation insurance, vehicles, meters, and financing. We have excellent relations with many of the most active brokers, and regularly receive referrals
from them.  The Newark Market. We estimate that Newark medallions sold for approximately $147,000, net, as of December 31,
2018. The number of Newark medallions has been limited to 600 since 1950 by local law. We estimate that the total value of all Newark medallions and related assets is over $91,800,000 as of December 31, 2018. 
The Chicago Market. We estimate that Chicago medallions sold for approximately $27,000, net, as of December 31, 2018. Pursuant to
a municipal ordinance, the number of outstanding medallions is capped at 6,995 as of December 31, 2018. We estimate that the total value of all Chicago medallions and related assets is over $230,835,000 as of December 31, 2018. 
Other Markets. We estimated that Boston and Cambridge medallions sold for approximately $43,000 and $22,000, net, as of
December 31, 2018. These other markets make up 0.4% of our total medallion loans receivable.  Our Strategy 
Our core philosophy has been In niches there are riches. We try to identify markets that are profitable and where we can be an
industry leader. Key elements of our strategy include:  Capitalize on our relationships with brokers and dealers. We are committed
to establishing, building, and maintaining our relationships with our brokers and dealers. Our marketing efforts are focused on building relationships with dealers in the consumer markets as we work directly with dealerships, contractors and FSPs to
offer quality financing for their customers, including those with past credit challenges. We believe that our relationships with dealers and brokers provide us with, in addition to potential investment opportunities, other significant benefits,
including an additional layer of due diligence and additional monitoring capabilities. We have assembled a management team that has developed an extensive network of dealer and broker relationships 
  7 






in our target markets over the last 50 years. We believe that our management teams relationships with these dealers and brokers have and will continue to provide us with significant
investment opportunities. In 2018, 100% of our consumer loans were generated by brokers and dealers, and there were few originations in the medallion or commercial lending space. 
Focus on niche industries and our expertise in these niche fields. We specialize in providing consumer loans for the purchase of
recreational vehicles (RVs), boats and trailers, and to finance home improvements through contractors and suppliers in the home improvement sector. We believe our focus on these niche areas provides us with an opportunity to realize favorable
returns, with less competition.  Employ disciplined underwriting policies and maintain rigorous portfolio monitoring. We have an
extensive loan underwriting and monitoring process. We conduct a thorough analysis of each potential loan portfolio and its prospects, competitive position, financial performance, and industry dynamics. We stress the importance of credit and risk
analysis in our underwriting process. We believe that our continued adherence to this disciplined process will permit us to continue to generate a stable, diversified and increasing revenue stream of current income from our earning assets to enable
us to make distributions to our shareholders.  Leverage the skills of our experienced management team. Our management team is led
by our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alvin Murstein, and our President, Mr. Andrew M. Murstein. Alvin Murstein has over 60 years of experience in the ownership, management, and financing of taxicab medallions and other commercial
businesses, and Andrew M. Murstein is the third generation in his family to participate in the business and has over 30 years of experience in the ownership, management, and financing of taxicab medallions and other commercial businesses. The
other members of our management team including Medallion Bank have broad investment backgrounds, with prior experience in banking and non-bank consumer lending, at specialty finance companies, middle market
commercial banks, and other financial services companies. We believe that the experience and contacts of our management team will continue to allow us to effectively implement the key aspects of our business strategy. 
Perform Strategic Acquisitions. In addition to increasing market share in existing lending markets and identifying new niches, we seek
to acquire medallion financing businesses and related portfolios and specialty finance companies that make secured loans to small businesses which have experienced historically low loan losses similar to our own. Since our initial public offering in
May 1996, we have acquired eight specialty finance companies, five loan portfolios, and three taxicab rooftop advertising companies.

Loan/Investment Activity 
The following table sets forth the components of loan/investment activity in the consolidated/managed investment portfolio for the years
indicated.   
 





Loan/Investment Characteristics 
Consumer Loans. Consumer loans generally require equal monthly payments covering accrued interest and amortization of principal over a
negotiated term, generally around ten to twelve years. Interest rates offered are fixed. Borrowers may prepay consumer loans without any prepayment penalty. In general, Medallion Bank has established relationships with dealers, FSPs, and contractors
in the industry, who are the sources for consumer loan volumes. The loans are made up of recreation loans and home improvement loans which were 76% and 24% of total consumer loans at December 31, 2018. 
Our recreation loans are secured primarily by RVs, boats and trailers with a small proportion of loans secured by other collateral such as
autos, motorcycles and boat motors. These loans, which together make up our largest and most profitable loan portfolio, have a weighted average yield of 16.88% at December 31, 2018. Our home improvement loans are secured by the personal
property installed, and the security interest for a majority of these loans is perfected with a UCC fixture filing. As of December 31, 2018, these loans had a weighted average yield of 9.20%. 
  9 





Commercial Loans. We have typically originated commercial loans in principal amounts
generally ranging from under $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, and occasionally have originated loans in excess of that amount. These loans are generally retained and typically have maturities ranging from three to ten years and require monthly payments
ranging from full amortization over the loan term to fully deferred interest and principal at maturity, with multiple payment options in between. Substantially all loans may be prepaid, and in the first five years, a fee will be owed to us. The term
of, and interest rate charged on, certain of our outstanding loans are subject to the regulations of the Small Business Administration, or the SBA. Under SBA regulations, the maximum rate of interest permitted on loans originated by us is 19%;
however, terms and interest rates are subject to market competition for all loans. Unlike medallion loans, for which competition and market conditions preclude us from charging the maximum rate of interest permitted under SBA regulations, we are
able to charge the maximum rate on certain commercial loans.  Medallion Loans. Our medallion loan portfolio consists of mostly
fixed-rate loans, collateralized by first security interests in taxicab medallions and related assets (vehicles, meters, and the like). We estimate that the weighted average
loan-to-value ratio of all of the medallion loans was 220% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 131% as of December 31, 2017. These ratios do not factor in the
reserve on these loans of $27,743,000 as of December 31, 2018 and the unrealized depreciation on managed loans of $62,723,000 as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we have recourse against a vast majority of the owners of the taxicab
medallions and related assets through personal guarantees.  Medallion loans generally require equal monthly payments covering accrued
interest and amortization of principal over a five to twenty-five year schedule, subject to a balloon payment of all outstanding principal at maturity. Historically, we have originated loans with one-to-five year maturities where interest rates are adjusted and a new maturity period set. 
Historically, we have retained the medallion loans we originate; however, from time to time, we participate or sell shares of some loans or
portfolios to interested third party financial institutions. In these cases, we retain the borrower relationships and service the sold loans. 
Marketing, Origination, and Loan Approval Process 
We employ 78 personnel to originate, manage, service and collect on the consumer, commercial, and medallion loans. Each loan application is
individually reviewed through analysis of a number of factors, including loan-to-value ratios, a review of the borrowers credit history, public records, personal
interviews, trade references, personal inspection of the premises, and approval from the TLC, SBA, or other regulatory body, if applicable. Each medallion and commercial loan applicant is required to provide personal or corporate tax returns,
premises leases, and/or property deeds. The Companys senior management establishes loan origination criteria. Loans that conform to such criteria may be processed by a loan officer with the proper credit authority, and non-conforming loans (other than those by the Bank) must be approved by the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President, and/or the Chief Credit Officer and the Investment Oversight Committee of the
Companys Board of Directors. Loan criteria for loans originated with the Bank is established by the Banks board of directors and senior management. The Banks policies identify specific approval authorities for its recreation, home
improvement, medallion and real estate loans. Policy exceptions are reported to the Banks board of directors. Both medallion and commercial loans are sourced from brokers with extensive networks of applicants, and commercial loans are also
referred by contacts with banks, attorneys, and accounting firms. Consumer loans are primarily sourced through relationships which have been established with recreational vehicle and boat dealers, and home improvement contractors throughout our
market area.  Sources of Funds  We
have historically funded our lending operations primarily through credit facilities with bank syndicates and, to a lesser degree, through equity or debt offerings or private placements, and fixed-rate, senior secured

  10 






notes and long-term subordinated debentures issued to or guaranteed by the SBA. Since the inception of Medallion Bank, substantially all of Medallion Banks funding has been provided by FDIC
insured brokered certificates of deposit. The determination of funding sources is established by our management, based upon an analysis of the respective financial and other costs and burdens associated with funding sources. Our funding strategy and
interest rate risk management strategy is to have the proper structuring of debt to minimize both rate and maturity risk, while maximizing returns with the lowest cost of funding over an intermediate period of time. 
The table below summarizes our sources of available funds and amounts outstanding under credit facilities and their respective end of period
weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2018. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about each credit facility.   
We fund our fixed-rate loans with variable-rate credit lines and bank debt, and with fixed-rate SBA debentures
and borrowings. The mismatch between maturities and interest-rate sensitivities of these balance sheet items results in interest rate risk. We seek to manage our exposure to increases in market rates of interest to an acceptable level by: 
 

 

Nevertheless, we accept varying degrees of interest rate risk depending on market conditions. For additional discussion of our funding sources
and asset liability management strategy, see Asset/Liability Management on page 65.  Competition 
Banks, credit unions, and finance companies, some of which are SBICs, compete with us in originating medallion, commercial, and consumer loans.
Many of these competitors have greater resources than we do and 
  11 






certain competitors are subject to less restrictive regulations than us. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and complete the financing transactions that will
permit us to compete successfully.  Employees 
As of December 31, 2018 we employed 177 persons, including 75 at our Medallion Bank subsidiary. We believe that relations with our
employees are good.  MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
For our tax years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have been taxed as a corporation and must pay corporate-level federal and state
income taxes on our taxable income. Because we were taxed as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) for the tax year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we are able to carry forward any net operating losses
incurred to succeeding years. In addition, distributions will generally be taxable to our shareholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal tax purposes. Distributions in excess of our current and
accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of a shareholders tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Subject to certain limitations under the Code,
corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government signed into
law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which, starting in 2018, reduced the Companys corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, but eliminated or increased certain permanent differences. 
REGULATION  Exemption from the 1940 Act 
In order to maintain our status as a non-investment company, we operate so as to fall outside the
definition of an investment company or within an applicable exception. We expect to continue to fall within the exception from the definition of an investment company provided under Section 3(c)(6) of the 1940 Act as a
company primarily engaged, directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries, in the business of, among other things, (i) banking, (ii) purchasing and otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other
obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance and services, and (iii) making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance, and
services. We monitor our continued compliance with this exception, which we have met since April 2, 2018, and were compliant as of December 31, 2018. 
Regulation of Medallion Bank as an Industrial Bank 
In May 2002, we formed Medallion Bank, which received approval from the FDIC for federal deposit insurance in October 2003. Medallion Bank, a
Utah-chartered industrial bank, is a depository institution subject to regulatory oversight and examination for safety and soundness by both the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Medallion Bank is examined annually by the FDIC
and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Numerous other federal and state laws and regulations govern almost all aspects of Medallion Banks operations and, to some degree, our operations and those of our non-bank subsidiaries as institution-affiliated parties. Under its banking charter, Medallion Bank is empowered to make consumer and commercial loans, and may accept all FDIC-insured deposits other than demand
deposits (checking accounts). Medallion Bank provides stable and low-cost bank deposit funding for our key lending business activities conducted through Medallion Bank. 
In addition, the FDIC has regulatory authority to prohibit Medallion Bank from engaging in any unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its
business. 
  12 





Medallion Bank is subject to risk-based and leverage capital standards issued by the federal
banking regulators. These standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, to account for off-balance sheet exposure,
to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets, and to achieve greater consistency in evaluating the capital adequacy of major banks throughout the world. Under the risk-based capital standards, assets and
off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with designated weights, and the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.  In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency adopted the U.S. Basel III capital rules, which implement many aspects of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions Basel III capital framework and are aimed at increasing both the quantity and quality of regulatory capital.
The requirements in the U.S. Basel III capital rules began to phase in on January 1, 2015, for many covered banking organizations, including Medallion Bank. Most requirements in the U.S. Basel III capital rules were fully phased in by
January 1, 2019. Because Medallion Bank was already subject to a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC that required it to hold capital in excess of the then applicable capital requirements, we do not believe that the U.S. Basel III
capital rules will have a material impact on Medallion Banks business.  Under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, Medallion Bank is
subject to the following minimum capital ratios:   

 

 

 

In addition, Medallion Bank is subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum risk-based capital ratios.
The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increased by 0.625% each subsequent January 1 until January 1, 2019. Including the buffer, as of January 1, 2019, Medallion
Bank is be required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios: a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 8.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of greater than
10.5%. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of qualifying minority interests that
are in the form of common stock. For Medallion Bank to pay a dividend, they would need to comply with these capital requirements.  The
U.S. Basel III capital rules retain or modify certain deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital and also provide for new ones. In addition, the U.S. Basel III capital rules provide for limited recognition in Common Equity Tier 1 capital,
and deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 capital above certain thresholds, of three categories of assets: (i) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks (net of related
valuation allowances and of deferred tax liabilities), (ii) mortgage servicing assets (net of associated deferred tax liabilities) and (iii) investments in more than 10% of the issued and outstanding common stock of unconsolidated financial
institutions (net of associated deferred tax liabilities).  For purposes of calculating the denominator of the three risk-based capital
ratios, the assets of covered banking organizations are given risk weights that, under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, range from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the nature of the asset. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury or obligations
unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. government have a 0% risk weight, while general obligation claims on states or other political subdivisions of the United States are assigned a 20% risk weight, except for municipal or state revenue bonds,
which have a 50% risk weight. Most first-lien residential mortgage exposures that are prudently underwritten and performing according to their original terms carry a 50% risk weight, with a 100% 
  13 






risk weight for other residential mortgage exposures. In addition, certain off-balance sheet items are assigned credit conversion factors to convert them
to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk weight is applied. For example, the unused portion of unconditionally cancellable commitments is assigned a 0% conversion factor, while self-liquidating, transaction-related contingent items
with an original maturity of one year or less and the amount of a commitment with an initial maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable by the covered banking organization are converted at 20%. Transaction-related
contingencies such as bid bonds and standby letters of credit backing nonfinancial obligations, as well as the amount of a commitment with an original maturity of more than one year that is not unconditionally cancellable, have a 50% conversion
factor. General guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations are given a 100% conversion factor.  In addition,
pursuant to provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, and related regulations with respect to prompt corrective action, FDIC-insured institutions such as Medallion Bank may only accept brokered deposits without FDIC permission if
they meet specified capital standards, and are subject to restrictions with respect to the interest they may pay on deposits unless they are well capitalized. The U.S. Basel III capital rules revised the capital threshold to be well capitalized.
Effective January 1, 2015, in order to qualify as well capitalized, an insured depository institution must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total
risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and the bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level. 
Pursuant to a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC, we and Medallion Bank have agreed that the capital levels of Medallion Bank will at
all times meet or exceed the levels required for Medallion Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the FDIC rules and regulations, that Medallion Banks Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio will be maintained at not less than 15%,
and that Medallion Bank will maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses. As of December 31, 2018, Medallion Bank was in compliance with the above rules and tests. 
Medallion Bank is also subject to certain federal laws that restrict and control its ability to extend credit and provide or receive services
between affiliates. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder limit the transfer of funds by a depository institution to certain of its affiliates, including us, in the form of loans, extensions of
credit, investments, or purchases of assets. Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W also require generally that the depository institutions transactions with its affiliates be on terms no less favorable to Medallion Bank than comparable
transactions with unrelated third parties.  The USA Patriot Act and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist
Financing Act of 2001, or the Patriot Act, is intended to detect and prosecute terrorism and international money laundering. The Patriot Act establishes new standards for verifying customer identification incidental to the opening of new accounts.
Medallion Bank has undertaken appropriate measures to comply with the Patriot Act and associated regulations. Other provisions of the Patriot Act provide for special information sharing procedures governing communications with the government and
other financial institutions with respect to suspected terrorists and money laundering activity, and enhancements to suspicious activity reporting, including electronic filing of suspicious activity reports over a secure filing network. The
compliance programs required by the Patriot Act are intended to supplement pre-existing compliance requirements that apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets
Control, or OFAC, regulations to which Medallion Bank is also subject. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions, including banks, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to
prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Bank Secrecy Act includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation
requirements. Medallion Bank has in place policies, procedures and internal controls in order to comply with Bank Secrecy Act and OFAC laws and regulations. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are
required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. 
  14 





Federal and state banking agencies require Medallion Bank to prepare annual reports on
financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures. Medallion Bank must undergo regular on-site examinations by the appropriate banking
agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution. The results of the
examination are confidential. The cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate. 
Regulation by the SBA  Medallion Funding,
Medallion Capital, and Freshstart are each licensed by the SBA to operate as SBICs, under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, or the SBIA. The SBIA authorizes the organization of SBICs as vehicles for providing equity capital,
long term financing, and management assistance to small business concerns. Under the regulations promulgated by the SBA a small business concern is defined as a business that is independently owned and operated, which does not dominate
its field of operation, and which (i) has a tangible net worth, together with any affiliates, of $19.5 million or less and average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes for the preceding two fiscal years of $6.5 million or
less (average annual net income is computed without the benefit of any carryover loss), or (ii) satisfies alternative criteria under the Federal governments North American Classification System, or the NAICS, that assigns codes to the
industry in which a small business is engaged and provides a small business size standard based either on the number of persons employed by the business or its gross revenues. In addition, at the end of each fiscal year, at least 25% of the total
amount of loans made (after April 25, 1994) must be made in smaller businesses that have a net worth of $6.0 million or less, and average net income after federal income taxes for the preceding two years of $2.0 million or
less. A business that meets the NAICS size standards also qualifies as a smaller business for purposes of meeting SBAs size standard regulations. 
Investments by SBICs must be in active, primarily domestic businesses. SBIC regulations preclude investment in the following types of
businesses: (1) financial companies whose principal business activity is as a relender or reinvestor (that is, directly or indirectly, providing funds to others, purchasing debt obligations, factoring, or long term leasing of equipment with no
provision for maintenance or repair); (2) many kinds of real estate projects; (3) single purpose projects that are not continuing businesses; (4) companies located outside the U.S. intending to use the proceeds of the investment outside of
the U.S. or companies that are located in the U.S. that have more than 50% of their employees or tangible assets located outside of the U.S.; (5) businesses that are passive and do not carry on an active trade or business; (6) businesses that
use 50% or more of the funds to buy goods or services from an associated supplier; and (7) certain sin businesses such as gambling and the like. Nonetheless, the regulations provide an exception to (1) above for an SBIC that
provides Venture Capital Financing investments (represented by common or preferred stock, a limited partnership interest or a similar partnership interest) to a Disadvantaged Business that is a relender or reinvestor (except banks or savings and
loans insured by agencies of the Federal Government, and agricultural credit companies), so long as, without SBA prior approval, total outstanding financings do not exceed the SBICs regulatory capital at the end of its fiscal year. 
Under current SBA regulations, the maximum rate of interest that Medallion Funding, Medallion Capital and Freshstart may charge may not exceed
the higher of (i) 19% or (ii) the sum of (a) the higher of (i) that companys weighted average cost of qualified borrowings, as determined under SBA regulations, or (ii) the current SBA debenture rate, plus
(b) 11%, rounded to the next lower eighth of one percent. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum rate of interest permitted on loans originated by Medallion Funding, Medallion Capital, and Freshstart was 19%. As of December 31, 2018,
our outstanding medallion loans had a weighted average rate of interest 4.43% and our outstanding commercial loans had a weighted average rate of interest of 13.56%. Current SBA regulations also require that each loan originated by an SBIC has a
term between one and 20 years.  In addition, SBICs are subject to periodic examination by the SBA, for which the SBA charges examination
fees. SBICs are required to maintain certain minimum levels of capital and must maintain certain records and 
  15 






make them available for SBA examination. SBICs also are required to prepare valuations of their portfolio investments in accordance with prescribed valuation guidelines, to maintain certain
minimum levels of capital, to file annual reports containing financial, management and other information and to file notices of certain material changes in their ownership and operations. We are examined by the SBA annually for compliance with
applicable SBA regulations.  SBICs are precluded from making investments in a small business if it would give rise to a conflict of
interest. Generally, a conflict of interest may arise if an associate of the SBIC has or makes an investment in the small business the SBIC is financing or serves as one of its officers or would otherwise benefit from the financing. A conflict of
interest would also occur if an SBIC were to lend money to any of its officers, directors, and employees, or invest in any affiliates thereof. Joint investing with an associate (such as another fund controlled by affiliates of the general partner of
the fund) may be made on identical terms or on terms that are fair to the SBIC. The SBA also prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a change of control or transfers which would result in any person (or group of persons acting in concert)
owning 10% or more of any class of capital stock of an SBIC. A change of control is any event which would result in the transfer of the power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of an SBIC, whether through
ownership, contractual arrangements, or otherwise.  Under SBA regulations, without prior SBA approval, loans by licensees with outstanding
SBA leverage to any single small business concern may not exceed 30% of an SBICs regulatory capital, as defined in the SBIA.  SBICs
must invest idle funds that are not being used to make loans in investments permitted under SBA regulations. These permitted investments include direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the government of the
U.S. with a term of 15 months or less and deposits maturing in one year or less issued by an institution insured by the FDIC. These permitted investments must be maintained in (i) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal
and interest by, the U.S., which mature within 15 months from the date of the investment; (ii) repurchase agreements with federally insured institutions with a maturity of seven days or less if the securities underlying the repurchase
agreements are direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S., and such securities must be maintained in a custodial account in a federally insured institution; (iii) mutual funds, securities, or other
instruments that exclusively consist of, or represent pooled assets of, investments described in (i) or (ii) above; (iv) certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less, issued by a federally insured institution;
(v) a deposit account in a federally insured institution, subject to withdrawal restriction of one year or less; (vi) a checking account in a federally insured institution; or (vii) a reasonable petty cash fund. 
SBICs may purchase voting securities of small business concerns in accordance with SBA regulations. Although prior regulations prohibited an
SBIC from controlling a small business concern except in limited circumstances, SBA regulations allow an SBIC to exercise control over a small business for a period of seven years from the date on which the SBIC initially acquires its control
position. This control period may be extended for an additional period of time with the SBAs prior written approval.  If an SBIC
defaults in its payment obligations to SBA under its outstanding debentures, fails to comply with any terms of its securities, or violates any law or regulation applicable to it, the SBA has the right to accelerate the maturity of all amounts due
under its debentures. Additionally, the SBA can bring suit for the appointment of a receiver for the SBIC and for its liquidation in the event a default on payment of a SBICs debentures or for serious regulatory violations. 
Other  Because Medallion Bank is an
insured depository institution within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act and we are a financial institution holding company within the meaning of the Utah Financial
Institutions Act, federal and Utah law and regulations prohibit any person or 
  16 






company from acquiring control of us and, indirectly, Medallion Bank, without, in most cases, prior written approval of the FDIC or the Commissioner of Utah Department of Financial Institutions,
as applicable. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires 25% or more of any class of our voting stock. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or
company acquires 10% or more of any class of voting stock and is subject to a number of specified control factors as set forth in the applicable regulations. Although Medallion Bank is an
insured depository institution within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank
Control Act, your investment in Medallion Financial Corp. is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC, or any other agency, and is
subject to loss. Under the Utah Financial Institutions Act, control is defined as the power to vote 20% or more of any class of our voting securities by an individual or to vote more than 10% of any class of our voting
securities by a person other than an individual. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our common stock in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. 
In addition to the regulations detailed above, our operations are subject to supervision and regulation by other federal, state, and local
laws and regulations. Additionally, our operations may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions. This oversight may serve to:   
 

 

 

 
 

 
Changes to laws of states in which we do business could affect the operating environment in substantial and
unpredictable ways. We cannot predict whether such changes will occur or, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure 
Our business is heavily concentrated in consumer lending, which carries a high risk of loss and could be adversely affected by an economic
downturn.  Our business is heavily concentrated in consumer lending. As a result, we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks
particular to consumer credit than a more diversified company. For example, our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the U.S. economy, consumer spending and consumer credit. We are also more susceptible to the
risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer (including promotional financing). Our business concentration could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.  By its nature, lending to consumers carries with it different risks and typically a higher
risk of loss than commercial lending. Although the net interest margins are intended to be higher to compensate us for this increased risk, an economic downturn could result in higher loss rates and lower returns than expected, and could affect the
profitability of our consumer loan portfolio. During periods of economic slowdown, such as the 2007-2009 recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses generally increase, and consumers are likely to reduce their discretionary
spending in areas such as recreation and home improvement, which comprise a high proportion of our business. These periods may also be accompanied by increasing unemployment rates and declining values of consumer products securing outstanding
accounts, which weaken collateral coverage and increase the amount of a loss in the event of default.  Additionally, higher gasoline
prices, volatile real estate values and market conditions, reset of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, general availability of consumer credit, or other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase
loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for RVs, boats, trailers and other consumer products (including in connection with home improvement projects), as well as weaken collateral values on certain types of consumer products. Any decrease in
consumer demand for those products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to originate new loans and, accordingly, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Although declines in commodity prices, and more particularly gasoline prices, generally are financially beneficial to the individual consumer,
such declines may also have a negative impact on unemployment rates in geographic areas that are highly dependent upon the oil and natural gas industry, which could adversely affect the credit quality of consumers in those areas. 
Our balance sheet consists of a significant percentage of nonprime consumer loans, which are associated with higher than average delinquency
rates. The actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. In addition, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase
without a corresponding increase in our net interest income.  Furthermore, our business is significantly affected by monetary and
regulatory policies of the U.S. Federal Government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on us through
interest rate changes, costs of compliance with increased regulation, and other factors. Although market conditions have improved since the 2007-2009 recession, conditions remain challenging for financial institutions. 
The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions
and how those economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. The degree of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates, which may, in turn, impact the reliability
of the process and the quality of our assets. 
  18 





Changes in the taxicab and for-hire vehicle
industries have resulted in significantly increased competition and have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations. 
There have been changes in the taxicab and for-hire vehicle industries that have resulted in
significantly increased competition in all of our taxi medallion markets. Ridesharing applications, or ridesharing apps, utilized by for-hire vehicles were introduced in New York City in 2011 and continue to
expand domestically and globally. Many of these for-hire vehicle operators operate outside of the regulatory regime with which we and our borrowers operate. As a result, there is an increased risk in
competition because such operators are able to pass the cost savings of not having to comply with certain regulations to its passengers. Since 2017, New York State, New York City Council and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commissions have made
several changes to the medallion classes and regulations forcing greater transparency and equal regulation among transportation companies, including; eliminating the distinction between individual and corporate medallions, temporarily capping the
number of ride-sharing licenses, minimum-wage regulations for for-hire vehicle (FHV) companies, and congestion pricing. Until the market fully stabilizes we will not be able to determine the ultimate impact of
these changes. According to the TLC, between January 2018 and January 2019 approximately 15,500 new for-hire vehicle licenses were issued, increasing the total number of
for-hire vehicles to approximately 120,608 as of January 25, 2019, a 14.8% increase from January 2018. 
In addition, the New York State legislature enacted a law on December 21, 2011, which was amended on February 17, 2012, to permit
cars for-hire to pick up street hails in boroughs outside of Manhattan. Pursuant to this law the TLC has issued approximately 8,300 Street Hail Livery licenses since June 2013, of which approximately 3,400 are
active.  TLC annualized data through November 2018 has shown a 8.9% reduction in total New York City taxicab fares, compared to the
annualized data of December 2017, and a 9.1% reduction in the total number of New York City taxicab trips. Such reductions in fare totals and taxicab trips are likely the result of a combination of ridesharing apps, Street Hail Livery licenses, and
other forms of public transportation.  As of December 31, 2018, 8.6% of our medallion loan portfolio was 90 days or more past due. As
discussed in further detail below, there have also been recent decreases in the values of our medallion loan collateral and our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure. Increased competition from ridesharing apps and Street Hail Livery
licenses has reduced our market share, the overall market for taxicab services, the supply of taxicab drivers, income from operating medallions, and the value of taxicab medallions. If these trends continue and intensify, there would be a further
material increase to our loan to value ratios, loan delinquencies, and loan defaults resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Decreases in the value of our medallion loan collateral and our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure have had, and may continue
to have, a material adverse effect on our business.  A significant portion of our loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by
New York City taxicab medallions. According to TLC data, over the past 20 years New York City taxicab medallions had appreciated in value from under $200,000 to $1,320,000 for corporate medallions and $1,050,000 for individual medallions in
2014. However, based on our evaluation of various sale transactions and cash flows of our underlying borrowers performance, we determined that a market value of $186,400, $181,000 net of liquidation costs, was appropriate, reflecting the median
transactional activity for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.  We own 159 Chicago taxicab medallions that were purchased out of
foreclosure in 2003. Additionally, a portion of our loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by Chicago taxicab medallions. The Chicago medallions had appreciated in value from $50,000 in 2003 to approximately $370,000 in 2013. Since that
time, however, there has been a decline in the value of Chicago taxicab medallions to approximately $28,000, $27,160 net of liquidation costs, as of December 31, 2018. 
  19 





Decreases in the value of our medallion loan collateral have resulted in an increase in the loan-to-value ratios of our medallion loans. We estimate that the weighted average
loan-to-value ratio of our medallion loans was approximately 220% as of December 31, 2018. If taxicab medallion values continue to decline, there could be an
increase in medallion loan delinquencies, foreclosures, and borrower bankruptcies. Our ability to recover on defaulted medallion loans by foreclosing on and selling the medallion collateral could be diminished, which could result in material losses
on defaulted medallion loans which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Continued decreases in the value of our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure could adversely affect our ability to dispose of such medallions at
times when it may be advantageous for us to do so. If we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our medallions quickly, we could realize less than the value at which we had previously recorded such medallions. 
Our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations depend on the credit performance of our loans. 
As of December 31, 2018, more than half of our recreation loans are nonprime receivables with obligors who do not qualify for conventional
consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, adverse credit history. While our underwriting guidelines are designed to confirm that, notwithstanding such factors, the obligor would be a reasonable credit risk, the receivables
nonetheless are expected to experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime obligors. The weakening of our underwriting guidelines for any reason, such as in response to the competitive environment, in an effort to originate
higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans or our inability to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or other conditions, may result in loan defaults and
charge-offs that may necessitate increases to our allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income and financial condition. In the event of a default on a recreation loan, generally the most practical recovery method is
repossession of the financed vehicle, although the collateral value of the vehicle usually does not fully cover the outstanding account balance and costs of recovery. Repossession sales that do not yield sufficient proceeds to repay the receivables
in full typically result in losses on those receivables.  In addition, our prime portfolio has grown in proportion to our overall
portfolio over the past several years. While prime portfolios typically have lower default rates than nonprime portfolios, we have less ability to make risk adjustments to the pricing of prime loans compared to nonprime loans. As a result, to the
extent our prime portfolio continues to grow, a larger proportion of our business will consist of loans with respect to which we will have less flexibility to adjust pricing to absorb losses. As a result of these factors, we may sustain higher
losses than anticipated in our prime portfolio. Additionally, if our prime loan losses are higher than expected then we may also be at risk with regards to our forecasted losses, which could impact our loss reserves and results of operations. 
We are subject to certain financial covenants and other restrictions under our loan and credit arrangements, which could affect our ability
to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.  Our loan and credit agreements contain
financial covenants and other restrictions relating to borrowing base eligibility, tangible net worth, net income, leverage ratios, shareholders equity, and collateral values. Our ability to meet these financial covenants and restrictions
could be affected by events beyond our control, such as a substantial decline in collateral values or a rise in borrower delinquencies. A breach of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument. Such a
default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that is subject to an applicable cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. Most of our credit facility
debt is subject to cross default provisions. Certain other events can constitute an event of default. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral
granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or holders of the related notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that

  20 






indebtedness. We have regularly needed waivers and extensions and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to continue to get them if requested. Based on the foregoing factors, the
operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our current credit agreements and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. 
Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in developing and
maintaining our relationships with dealerships, contractors and FSPs.  We originate loans by working with third-party sellers of
consumer products and not working directly with consumers. As a result, our ability to originate consumer loans depends on our relationships with dealerships, contractors and FSPs. Although we have relationships with various dealerships, contractors
and FSPs, none of our relationships are exclusive and each may be terminated at any time. In particular, there is significant competition for the contractor and FSP relationships we depend on in connection with our home improvement lending business.
The loss of any of these relationships, our failure to develop additional relationships, and circumstances in which our existing dealer, contractor, and FSP relationships generate decreased sales and loan volume all may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss
on amounts invested, and increases the risk of investing in us.  Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or
loss on amounts invested, and therefore increase the risk associated with investing in us. We borrow from and issue senior debt securities to banks and other lenders, and through long-term subordinated SBA debentures. These creditors have fixed
dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our shareholders. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if
the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would
cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could reduce the amount available for
distribution payments.  As of December 31, 2018, we had $1,062,028,000 of outstanding indebtedness, with a weighted average borrowing
cost of 2.67%.  Most of our borrowing relationships have maturity dates during 2019 through 2021. We have been in active and ongoing
discussions with each of these lenders and have extended each of the facilities as they matured. Certain lenders have worked with us to extend and change the terms of the borrowing agreements. See Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for
a discussion of the current and new lending arrangements to date.  Failure to obtain an extension of our existing credit facilities or
failure to obtain additional revolving credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
We utilize secured revolving credit facilities and other facilities to fund our investments. We cannot guarantee that our credit facilities
will continue to be available beyond their current maturity dates on reasonable terms or at all or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. Our revolving
credit facilities have converted to term loans. Obtaining additional revolving credit facilities or other alternative sources of financing may be difficult and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms favorable to us or at all. The
availability of revolving credit facilities depends, in part, on factors outside of our control, including regulatory capital treatment for unfunded bank lines of credit, the financial strength and strategic objectives of the banks that participate
in our credit facilities and the availability of bank liquidity in general. If the credit facilities are not renewed or extended by our lenders by their maturity dates, we will not be able to make further borrowings under the facilities after

  21 






they mature and the outstanding principal balances under such facilities will be due and payable at maturity. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment
obligations, our financial condition would be adversely affected and our lenders may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness. If we are unable to extend or replace these facilities or arrange new credit facilities or other types of
interim financing, we may need to curtail or suspend loan origination and funding activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
Our use of brokered deposits for our deposit-gathering activities may not be available when needed. The inability to accept and renew
brokered deposits would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.  We
rely on the established brokered deposit market to originate deposits to fund our operations. Additionally, our business, strategy and prospects are dependent on our ability to accept and renew brokered deposits without limitation and, therefore,
dependent on our ability to be well-capitalized under the FDICs regulatory framework.  Our brokered deposits consist of
deposits raised through the brokered deposit market rather than through retail branches. Although we have developed contractual relationships with a diversified group of investment brokers, and the brokered deposit market is well developed and
utilized by many banking institutions, conditions could change that might affect the availability of brokered deposits. In addition, our ability to rely on brokered deposits as a source of funding is subject to capitalization requirements set forth
in the FDICs prompt corrective action framework. We may not accept or renew brokered deposits unless we are well-capitalized or we are adequately capitalized and we receive a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is
adequately capitalized and that accepts or renews brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC is subject to additional restrictions on the interest rates it may offer. See Supervision and Regulation for additional
information.  If our capital levels fall below the well-capitalized level as defined by the FDIC our ability to raise brokered
deposits would be materially impaired. If our capital levels fall below the adequately capitalized level as defined by the FDIC, we would be unable to raise brokered deposits. Any impairment or inability to raise brokered deposits would
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Brokered deposits may also not be as stable as other types of deposits, and if we experience a period of sustained operating losses, the cost
of attracting deposits from the brokered deposit market could increase significantly. Our ability to manage our growth to stay within the well-capitalized level is critical to our ability to retain open access to this funding source.
The issuance of debt securities or preferred stock and our borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions may affect
holders of our common stock.  Our business may periodically require capital. We may issue debt securities or preferred stock, and/or
borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as senior securities. Any amounts that we use to service our debt or make payments on preferred stock will not be available for distributions to our common
shareholders. It is likely that any senior securities we issue will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, some of these securities or other indebtedness may be rated
by rating agencies, and in obtaining a rating for such securities and other indebtedness, we may be required to abide by operating and investment guidelines that further restrict operating and financial flexibility. We and, indirectly, our
shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities and other indebtedness. Preferred stock or any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences, and privileges more favorable
than those of our common stock, including separate voting rights, and could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control to the detriment of the holders of our common stock. 
If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the
percentage ownership of our shareholders at that time would decrease 
  22 






and they may experience dilution. Moreover, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to issue and sell additional equity securities in the future, on favorable terms or at all. 
We are dependent upon our key investment personnel for our future success. 
We depend on the diligence, skill, and network of business contacts of the investment professionals we employ for sourcing, evaluating,
negotiating, structuring, and monitoring our investments. Our future success will also depend, to a significant extent, on the continued service and coordination of our senior management team, particularly, Alvin Murstein, our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, Andrew M. Murstein, our President, Larry D. Hall, our Chief Financial Officer, Donald Poulton and his management team for Medallion Bank, and Alex Travis and his management team at Medallion Capital. The departure of
Messrs. Murstein or Mr. Hall, or any other member of our senior management team, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 
Changes in taxicab industry regulations that result in the issuance of additional medallions or increases in the expenses involved in
operating a medallion would decrease the value of our medallion loan collateral and our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure. 
Every city in which we originate medallion loans, and most other major cities in the United States, limits the supply of taxicab medallions.
This regulation results in supply restrictions that support the value of medallions. Actions that loosen these restrictions and result in the issuance of additional medallions into a market could decrease the value of medallions in that market. If
this were to occur, the value of the collateral securing our then outstanding medallion loans in that market would be adversely affected. We are unable to forecast with any degree of certainty whether any other potential increases in the supply of
medallions will occur.  In New York City, Chicago, Boston, and other markets where we originate medallion loans, taxicab fares are
generally set by government agencies. Expenses associated with operating taxicabs are largely unregulated. As a result, the ability of taxicab operators to recoup increases in expenses is limited in the short term. Escalating expenses, such as
rising gas prices and an increase in interest rates, can render taxicab operations less profitable, could cause borrowers to default on loans from us and would adversely affect the value of our collateral. 
We operate in a highly regulated environment, and if we are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state, or local laws or
regulations applicable to us, our business could suffer.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the
Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed federal financial services regulation and affects, among other things, the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of financial institutions and
their holding companies. In addition to the statutory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, the legislation also delegated authority to U.S. banking, securities and derivatives regulators to impose additional restrictions through required
rulemaking. The Dodd-Frank Act requires a company that owns an industrial bank to serve as a source of strength to the institution and is also subject to the Volcker Rule. Although these requirements have not materially
impacted us, we cannot assure you that they will not in the future.  Other changes in the laws or regulations applicable to us more
generally, may negatively impact the profitability of our business activities, require us to change certain of our business practices, materially affect our business model, limit the activities in which we may engage, affect retention of key
personnel, require us to raise additional regulatory capital, increase the amount of liquid assets that we hold, or otherwise affect our funding profile or expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). Any such changes may
also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition. 
  23 





We are also subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such
as local licensing requirements, and retail financing, debt collection, consumer protection, environmental, health and safety, creditor, wage-hour, anti-discrimination, whistleblower and other employment practices laws and regulations and we expect
these costs to increase going forward. The violation of these or future requirements or laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal sanctions against us, which may include fines, a cease and desist order against the
subject operations or even revocation or suspension of our license to operate the subject business. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs to comply with these requirements and
laws and regulations.  Changes in laws, regulations, or policies may adversely affect our business. 
The post-financial crisis era has been marked by an increase in regulation, regulatory intensity, and enforcement. We are unable to predict the
ways in which this change in the regulatory environment could impact our business models or objectives. The laws and regulations governing our lending, servicing, and debt collection activities or the regulatory or enforcement environment at the
federal level or in any of the states in which we operate may change at any time which may have an adverse effect on our business.  We
expect, however, to see an increase over time in regulatory scrutiny and enforcement in the area of consumer financial products regulation, as a result of the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, by the Dodd-Frank
Act. The CFPB is responsible for interpreting and enforcing a broad range of consumer protection laws that govern the provision of deposit accounts and the making of loans, including the regulation of mortgage lending and servicing and automobile
finance. While Medallion Banks size currently falls below the threshold that would give the CFPB direct authority over it, Medallion Banks existing bank supervisors may pursue similar policies and make similar information requests to
those of the CFPB with respect to consumer financial products and other matters within the scope of the CFPBs authority. We believe that the CFPBs regulatory reforms, together with other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and increased
regulatory supervision, may increase our cost of doing business, impose new restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or add significant operational constraints that might impair our profitability. 
We are unable to predict how these or any other future legislative proposals or programs will be administered or implemented or in what form,
or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements
in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently or that
new laws and regulations will not be adopted, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
Federal and state law may discourage certain acquisitions of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our
shareholders.  Because Medallion Bank is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act and we are a financial institution holding company within the meaning of the Utah Financial Institutions Act, federal and Utah law and regulations prohibit any person or company from
acquiring control of us and, indirectly Medallion Bank, without, in most cases, prior written approval of the FDIC or the Commissioner of the Utah Department of Financial Institutions, as applicable. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, control is
conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires 25% or more of any class of our voting stock. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires 10% or more of any class of voting stock and is
subject to a number of specified control 
  24 






factors as set forth in the applicable regulations. Under the Utah Financial Institutions Act, control is defined as the power to vote 20% or more of any class of our voting securities by
an individual or to vote more than 10% of any class of our voting securities by a person other than an individual. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our common stock in excess of the
amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. These provisions could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common
stock. Although Medallion Bank is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, your investment in Medallion Financial Corp. is not insured or
guaranteed by the FDIC, or any other agency, and is subject to loss. 
The banking industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory framework, together with any future legislative or regulatory changes, may
have a significant adverse effect on our operations.  The banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal
and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. We are subject to
regulation and supervision by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. The laws and regulations applicable to us govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, amounts, and terms of loans and investments we may make,
the maximum interest rate that may be charged, the amount of reserves we must hold against deposits we take, the types of deposits we may accept, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in the control of Medallion Bank and us,
restrictions on dividends, and establishment of new offices. As long as we remain well-capitalized under federal regulatory standards, there are no restrictions on the rates we may pay on brokered deposits. We must obtain approval from our
regulators before engaging in certain activities or acquisitions, and there is the risk that such approvals may not be obtained, either in a timely manner or at all. Our regulators also have the ability to compel us to take, or restrict us from
taking, certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws
and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Since the 2007-2009 recession, federal and state banking laws and regulations, as well as interpretations and implementations of these laws
and regulations, have undergone substantial review and change. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act drastically revised the laws and regulations under which we operate. Financial institutions generally have also been subjected to increased scrutiny
from regulatory authorities. These changes and increased scrutiny have resulted and may continue to result in increased costs of doing business and may in the future result in decreased revenues and net income, reduce our ability to effectively
compete to attract and retain customers, or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services. Any future changes in federal and state law and regulations, as well as the interpretations and implementations, or
modifications or repeals, of such laws and regulations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.  Our SBIC subsidiaries are licensed by the SBA, and are therefore subject to SBA regulations. 
Our SBIC subsidiaries are licensed to operate as SBICs and are regulated by the SBA. The SBA also places certain limitations on the financing
terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies and prohibits SBICs from providing funds for certain purposes or to businesses in a few prohibited industries. Compliance with SBA requirements may cause the SBIC subsidiaries to forego attractive
investment opportunities that are not permitted under SBA regulations.  Further, SBA regulations require that a licensed SBIC be
periodically examined and audited by the SBA to determine its compliance with the relevant SBA regulations. The SBA prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a 
  25 






change of control of an SBIC or transfers that would result in any person (or a group of persons acting in concert) owning 10% or more of a class of capital stock of an SBIC. If the
SBIC subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable SBIC regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibit their use of debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit them
from making new investments. In addition, the SBA could revoke or suspend an SBIC license or bring a suit for the appointment of a receiver for the SBIC and for its liquidation for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to
observe, any provision of the SBIA or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder. Such actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively affect us. 
Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could
result in fines or sanctions against us.  The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to design
and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury
Departments Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers and beneficial owners of certain legal entity
customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or
sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or expanding activities. During the last several years, a number of banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these
laws and regulations. Although we have policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work
effectively all of the time or protect us against liability for actions taken by our employees, agents, and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to
combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use
personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.  We are subject to various privacy, information security, and
data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively affected by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes
certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and
security practices and afford customers the right to opt out of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written
comprehensive information security program containing safeguards appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data
security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain
circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security, and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact
on our current and planned privacy, data protection, and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities.
This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission,
as well as at the state level. 
  26 





Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection, and information security laws
(including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or
governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
Having withdrawn our election to be regulated as a BDC, we must maintain an exception from registration under the 1940 Act which could
limit our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities, and the failure to maintain that exception could have material adverse consequences on our business. 
A company that meets the definition of an investment company under the 1940 Act, in the absence of an exception or exemption, must
either register with the SEC as an investment company or elect BDC status. Historically, the composition of the Companys assets caused us to meet the definition of an investment company, and the Company made a corresponding
election to be treated as a BDC. The Company has de-elected BDC status, and now operates so as to fall outside the definition of an investment company or within an applicable exception. The Company
expects to fall within the exception from the definition of an investment company provided under Section 3(c)(6) of the 1940 Act as a company primarily engaged, directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries, in the business of,
among other things, (i) banking, (ii) purchasing and otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance and services, and
(iii) making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance, and services. The Company is required to monitor its continued compliance with this exception, which could
limit our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities that would cause us to be out of compliance with its limitations and could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, we could be limited in growing
Medallion Capital, Inc., which is currently engaged in a business that generally does not qualify for the exception.  If the SEC or a
court were to find that we were required, but failed, to register as an investment company in violation of the 1940 Act, we may have to cease business activities, we would breach representations and warranties and/or be in default as to certain of
our contracts and obligations, civil or criminal actions could be brought against us, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court were to require enforcement and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our
business, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We operate in a highly competitive market for
investment opportunities.  We compete for loans/investments with other business development companies and other investment funds, as
well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and credit unions. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. For example, some
competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments. These characteristics could allow our
competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships, and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than us. We may be unwilling to match our competitors pricing, terms, and structure of certain loans
and investments opportunities due to potential risks, which may result in us earning less income than our competitors. If we are forced to match our competitors pricing, terms, and structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on
our investments or may bear substantial risk of capital loss. 
  27 





We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time. 
Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net interest income. 
Because we borrow to fund our loans and investments, a portion of our income is dependent upon the difference between the interest rate at
which we borrow funds and the interest rate at which we invest these funds. A portion of our investments, such as taxi medallion loans, will have fixed interest rates, while a portion of our borrowings will likely have floating interest rates. As a
result, a significant change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds could increase, which would reduce our net investment income. We may
hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments, subject to applicable legal requirements. These activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged
portfolio. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, we will have to rely on our counterparties
to perform their obligations under such hedges.  A decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments, which could
adversely affect our business.  Our commercial borrowers generally have the right to prepay their loans upon payment of a fee ranging
from 1% to 2% for standard loans, and for higher amounts, as negotiated, for larger more custom loan arrangements. A borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrowers loan is high
relative to prevailing interest rates. In a lower interest rate environment, we will have difficulty re-lending prepaid funds at comparable rates, which may reduce the net interest income that we receive. When
this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future investment in new portfolio companies. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid, and
we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely
affected if a substantial number of our portfolio companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us and we are not able to reinvest the proceeds for comparable yields in a timely fashion. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on
equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.  An increase in prevailing interest rates could
adversely affect our business.  The majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of fixed-rate loans. An abrupt increase in market rates
of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at higher prevailing interest rates. 
We depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to make distribution payments to our shareholders. 
We are primarily a holding company, and we derive most of our operating income and cash flow from our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely
heavily upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make distribution payments to our shareholders. Funds are provided to us by our subsidiaries through dividends and payments on intercompany indebtedness, but we
cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be in a position to continue to make these dividend or debt payments. The Utah Department of Financial Institutions and FDIC have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by
Medallion Bank. In addition, as a condition to receipt of FDIC insurance, Medallion Bank entered into a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC requiring it to maintain a 15% Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets). As of
December 31, 2018, Medallion Banks Tier 1 leverage ratio was 15.85%. We have not received dividends from Medallion Bank since 2016. 
  28 





Medallion Banks use of brokered deposit sources for its deposit-gathering
activities may not be available when needed.  Medallion Bank relies on the established brokered deposit market to originate deposits to
fund its operations. Medallion Banks brokered deposits consist of deposits raised through the brokered deposit market rather than through retail branches. While Medallion Bank has developed contractual relationships with a diversified group of
investment brokers, and the brokered deposit market is well developed and utilized by many banking institutions, conditions could change that might affect the availability of deposits. Applicable statutes and regulations restrict the use of brokered
deposits and the interest rates paid on such deposits for institutions that are less than well-capitalized. If the capital levels at Medallion Bank fall below the well-capitalized level as defined by the FDIC or the capital
level currently required by the FDIC pursuant to its capital maintenance agreement, or if Medallion Bank experiences a period of sustained operating losses, the cost of attracting deposits from the brokered deposit market could increase
significantly, and the ability of Medallion Bank to raise deposits from this source could be impaired. Brokered deposits may also not be as stable as other types of deposits. Medallion Banks ability to manage its growth to stay within the
well-capitalized level, and the capital level currently required by the FDIC pursuant to its capital maintenance agreement, which is also considerably higher than the level required to be classified as well-capitalized, is
critical to Medallion Banks retaining open access to this funding source.  Uncertainty relating to the reporting of collateral
values for our loans may adversely affect the value of our portfolio.  Medallion loans are primarily collateral-based lending, whereby
the collateral value exceeds the amount of the loan, providing sufficient excess collateral to protect us against losses. Despite our reliance on collateral values, medallions are income producing assets that generate cash flow which is utilized to
repay our loans. We rely on the integrity of the collateral value benchmarks obtained by the applicable regulatory agencies and other third parties. If these benchmarks are artificially influenced by market participants we could suffer losses. We
have experienced a significant downward movement in medallion collateral values which may continue, and has caused a negative impact on our valuation analysis and could result in further significant lower fair market value measurements of our
portfolio.  We require an objective benchmark in determining the fair value of our portfolio. If the benchmarks that we currently use are
deemed to be unreliable, we will need to use other intrinsic factors in determining the collateral values for our loans.  Our allowance
for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans.  We maintain an allowance for loan losses (a reserve
established through a provision for losses that decreases our earnings and that, accordingly, affects our financial condition) that we believe is appropriate to provide for incurred losses in our loan portfolio. 
The process for establishing an allowance for loan losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition, and requires
complex models and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, growth in our loan portfolio, changes in the credit characteristics of our loan portfolio, new information regarding our
loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. We may underestimate our incurred losses and fail to maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to account for these
losses. In cases where we modify a loan, if the modified loans do not perform as anticipated, we may be required to establish additional allowances on these loans. 
We periodically review and update our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to establish our
allowance for loan losses to reflect our view of current conditions. Moreover, 
  29 






our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review the methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use for calculating, and the
adequacy of, our allowance for loan losses. Our regulators, based on their judgment, may conclude that we should modify our methodology, models or the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments, increase our allowance for loan losses, and/or
recognize further losses. We continue to review and evaluate our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates, and assessments we use and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them, as needed. We cannot assure you
that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses. Future increases in the allowance for loan losses or recognized losses (as a result of any review, update, regulatory guidance, changes in accounting standards or otherwise) will
result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 
We generally make investments in private companies. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale
or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio
quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded our investments. We may also face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we have material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.  In addition, the illiquidity of our loan
portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In addition, if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in
the portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we borrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate
at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of rising
interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains. We use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing
activities. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with short-term floating-rate debt, and to a lesser extent by term fixed-rate debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to
interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and
no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, a hypothetical immediate 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to the line item net income as of December 31, 2018 by approximately $549,000
on an annualized basis, and the impact of such an immediate increase of 1% over a one year period would have been approximately ($1,012,000) at December 31, 2018. Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity
to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet, and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations in
a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates. 
We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results. 
We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including our ability to originate loans that
meet our investment criteria, the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of charge-offs and provision for loan losses, the degree to which we encounter
competition in our markets, and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.

A reduction in demand for our products and failure by us to adapt to such reduction could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The demand for the products we offer may be reduced due
to a variety of factors, such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences or financial conditions, regulatory restrictions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products. If we fail to
adapt to significant changes in our customers demand for, or access to, our products, our revenues could decrease and our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we do make changes to our product offerings to fulfill customer demand,
customers may resist such changes or may reject such products. Moreover, the effect of any product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time, and, by that time, it may be
too late to make further modifications to such product without causing further adverse effects to our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and
reputation to suffer.  In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business
information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in third-party data centers, and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to
our operations. Despite our security and business continuity measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions or vulnerable to other
disruptions as a result of system failures, operational events, employee error or incidents affecting our third-party service providers (or providers to those third-party service providers). Any such breach or disruption could compromise our
networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, destroyed or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, destruction or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that
protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we may also be required to incur significant costs in connection with any
regulatory investigation or civil litigation resulting from a security breach or other information technology disruption that affects us. 
Our operations could be interrupted if certain external vendors on which we rely experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to
comply with banking laws and regulations.  We depend to a significant extent on relationships with third parties that provide services,
primarily information technology services critical to our operations. Currently, we obtain services from third parties that include information technology infrastructure and support, plus loan origination, loan servicing, and accounting systems and
support. If any of our third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace our service providers with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. It may be difficult for us
to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our loan origination, loan servicing and accounting services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any
reason. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to replace these third parties, it may be at
higher cost to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if a third-party provider fails to provide the services we require, fails to meet contractual requirements,
such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or suffers a cyber-attack or other security breach, our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations. 
  31 





Our use of third-party vendors and our other ongoing third-party business relationships
are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.  We regularly use third-party vendors as part of our business. We also
have substantial ongoing business relationships with other third parties. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal and state bank regulators. Recent
regulation requires us to enhance our due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over our third-party vendors and other ongoing third-party business relationships. In certain cases, we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these
vendors to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase our costs and potentially limit our competitiveness. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party
relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third-party vendors or other ongoing third-party
business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for
customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Our business depends on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change. 
The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new, technology-driven
products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to serve customers better and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of customers by
using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological
improvements than we do. We may not be able to effectively implement new, technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, the implementation of technological changes
and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. Failure to successfully keep
pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and failure to avoid interruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
We expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the banking industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies
and business processes may be better than those we currently use. Because the pace of technological change is high and our industry is intensely competitive, we may not be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and
applications become obsolete or as better ones become available. A failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We depend on the accuracy and
completeness of information about customers.  In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating
and monitoring our loan portfolio on an ongoing basis, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those
customers or of other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial or
business information, or the failure to receive such information on a timely basis, could result in loan losses, reputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations. 
  32 





Terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, and natural disasters may affect any
market for our securities, impact the businesses in which we invest, and harm our operations and profitability.  Terrorist attacks and
natural disasters may harm our results of operations and your investment. We cannot assure you that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the U.S. or U.S. businesses or major natural disasters hitting the United States. Such attacks or
natural disasters in the U.S. or elsewhere may impact the businesses in which we directly or indirectly invest by undermining economic conditions in the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our business is focused in the New York
City metropolitan area, which suffered a terrorist attack in 2001 and has faced continued threats. Another terrorist attack in New York City or elsewhere could severely impact our results of operations. Losses resulting from terrorist attacks are
generally uninsurable.  Our financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to manage growth effectively.
Our ability to achieve our loan and investment objective will depend on our ability to grow, which will depend, in turn, on our
management teams ability to identify, evaluate, and monitor, and our ability to finance and invest in, companies that meet our investment criteria. 
Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis will be largely a function of our management teams handling of the investment
process, its ability to provide competent, attentive, and efficient services, and our access to financing on acceptable terms. In addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments, members of our management team and our investment
professionals may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. In order to grow, we will need to hire, train, supervise, and manage new
employees. However, we cannot assure you that any such employees will contribute to the success of our business. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.  Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted. 
The SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to lend money to any of their officers, directors, and employees, or invest in any affiliates thereof.
Medallion Bank is subject to certain federal laws that restrict and control its ability to engage in transactions with its affiliates.
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and applicable regulations restrict the transfer of funds by Medallion Bank to certain of its affiliates, including us, in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or purchases of assets
and restrict its ability to provide services to, or receive services from, its affiliates. Sections 23A and 23B also require generally that Medallion Banks transactions with its affiliates be on terms no less favorable to Medallion Bank than
comparable transactions with unrelated third parties.  Current or former employee misconduct could expose us to significant legal
liability and reputational harm.  We are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which integrity and the
confidence of the dealerships, contractors and FSPs that sell our consumer products are of critical importance. Our employees could engage, or our former directors, employees, or our controlling shareholder could have engaged, in misconduct that
adversely affects our business. For example, if such a person were to engage, or previously engaged, in fraudulent, illegal or suspicious activities, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation (as a
consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities), financial position, third-party relationships and ability to forge new relationships with third-party dealers or contractors. Our business often requires that we deal with
confidential information. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose this information, or if former directors, employees, or our controlling shareholder 
  33 






previously improperly used or disclosed this information, even if inadvertently, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships.
It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not always be effective. Misconduct by our employees or former directors, employees, or our controlling shareholder, or even
unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations 
Risks Relating to Our Loan Portfolios and Investments 
Lending to small businesses involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative. 
Lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk, which can result in substantial losses and should be
considered speculative. Historically, our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that may have limited resources and that are generally unable to obtain financing from traditional sources. There is generally no publicly available
information about these small business owners, and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions. In addition, these small businesses often do not have audited financial
statements. Some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition. Therefore, they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences, market conditions, or economic downturns, which may adversely affect the return
on, or the recovery of, our investment in these businesses.  Our portfolio is and may continue to be concentrated in a limited number
of portfolio companies, and industries and sectors, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations to us or by a downturn in the particular industry or sector. 
Our portfolio is and may continue to be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, and industries and sectors. In addition,
taxicab companies that constitute separate issuers may have related management or guarantors and constitute larger business relationships to us. As of December 31, 2018, New York City taxi medallion loans represented approximately 87% of our
taxi medallion loans, which in turn represented 16% of our net loan portfolio. We do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and while we are not targeting any specific industries, our investments are, and could continue to be, concentrated
in relatively few industries. As a result, the aggregate returns we realize may be adversely affected if a small number of loans perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one loan. If our larger borrowers were to significantly
reduce their relationships with us and seek financing elsewhere, the size of our loan portfolio and operating results could decrease. In addition, larger business relationships may also impede our ability to immediately foreclose on a particular
defaulted portfolio company as we may not want to impair an overall business relationship with either the portfolio company management or any related funding source. Additionally, a downturn in any particular industry or sector in which we are
invested could also negatively impact the aggregate returns we realize.  If we are unable to continue to diversify geographically, our
business may be further adversely affected if New York City experiences a sustained economic downturn.  Historically, a significant
portion of our loan revenue is derived from medallion loans collateralized by New York City taxicab medallions. An economic downturn in New York City could lead to an additional increase in defaults on our medallion loans. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to sufficiently diversify our operations geographically.  An economic downturn could result in additional commercial and
consumer loan customers experiencing declines in business activities and/or personal resources, which could lead to difficulties in their servicing of their loans with us, and increasing the level of delinquencies, defaults, and loan losses in our
commercial and consumer loan portfolios. 
  34 





Laws and regulations implemented in response to climate change could result in increased
operating costs for our portfolio companies.  Congress and other governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various
laws and regulations in response to climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gases. Existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations could be adopted, and future changes in environmental laws and
regulations could occur, which could impose additional costs on the operation of our portfolio companies. For example, regulations to cut gasoline use and control greenhouse gas emissions from new cars could adversely affect our medallion portfolio
companies. Our portfolio companies may have to make significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force our portfolio companies to incur significant expenses
or expenses that may exceed their estimates. There can be no assurance that such companies would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from their customers or that their business, financial condition or results of operations
would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in environmental laws and regulations, in which case the value of these companies could be adversely affected. 
Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies. 
We invest in our portfolio companies primarily through senior secured loans, junior secured loans, and subordinated debt issued by small- to mid-sized companies. Our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle
the holders to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution,
reorganization, or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying
such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any
distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company. 
There may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender
liability claims.  Even though we may have structured most of our investments as senior loans, if one of our portfolio companies were
to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt investment and subordinate all or a
portion of our claim to that of other creditors. We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a borrowers business or instances where we exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we
could become subject to a lenders liability claim, including as a result of actions taken in rendering significant managerial assistance. 
We may not control many of Medallion Capitals portfolio companies. 
We may not control many of Medallion Capitals portfolio companies, even though we may have board representation or board observation
rights. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a Medallion Capital portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the management of such company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not
serve our interests as debt investors. 
  35 





We may not realize gains from our equity investments. 
Certain investments that we have made in the past and may make in the future include warrants or other equity securities. In addition, we may
from time to time make non-control, equity co-investments in companies in conjunction with private equity sponsors. Our goal is ultimately to realize gains upon our
disposition of such equity interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do
realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. We also may be unable to realize any value if a portfolio company does not have a liquidity event, such as a sale of the business,
recapitalization, or public offering, which would allow us to sell the underlying equity interests.   

None.   

We lease office space in New York City for our corporate headquarters under a lease expiring in April 2027. We also lease office space for loan
origination offices and subsidiary operations in Long Island City, New York, Newark, New Jersey and Chicago, Illinois, which, along with our New York City office, handles our medallion loan segment, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, which handles our
commercial lending segment. Medallion Bank leases office space in Salt Lake City, Utah under a lease expiring in November 2023, which handles the recreation and home improvement lending segments, and Bothell, Washington, which handles our home
improvement lending segment. We do not own any real property, other than foreclosed properties obtained as a result of lending relationships. We believe that our leased properties, taken as a whole, are in good operating condition and are suitable
for our current business operations.   

We are currently involved in various legal proceedings incident to the ordinary course of our business, including collection matters with
respect to certain loans. We intend to vigorously defend any outstanding claims and pursue our legal rights. In the opinion of our management and based upon the advice of legal counsel, other than as set forth in the following paragraph there is no
proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of management threatened, which in the event of an adverse decision could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
On December 20, 2017, a stockholder derivative action was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York
(Shields v. Murstein, et al.). The complaint named us as a nominal defendant and purports to assert claims derivatively on our behalf against certain of our current directors, one of our former directors, and a former independent
contractor for one of our subsidiaries. The complaint alleged that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties with respect to certain alleged misconduct by the former independent contractor involving postings about us under an
alleged pseudonym. On January 25, 2018, we and the director defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action. On June 27, 2018, a hearing was held on the motion. On November 26, 2018, the Court entered a decision granting the
motion. On December 17, 2018, the Court entered an order dismissing the plaintiffs complaint with prejudice. The time for the plaintiff to appeal the Courts order has elapsed.

STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH 
The following graph commences as of December 31, 2013 and compares the Companys Common Stock with the cumulative total return for
the NASDAQ Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index. Furthermore, the following graph assumes the investment of $100 on December 31, 2013 in each of the Companys Common Stock, the stocks comprising the NASDAQ Composite Index and the
Russell 2000 Index and assumes dividends are reinvested.  Cumulative Total Return 
Based on Initial Investment of $100 on December 31, 2013

Our common stock is quoted on NASDAQ under the symbol MFIN. Our common stock commenced trading
on May 23, 1996. As of March 11, 2019, there were approximately 324 holders of record of our common stock. On March 11, 2019, the last reported sale price of our common stock was $6.60 per share. 
We are subject to federal and applicable state corporate income taxes on our taxable ordinary income and capital gains, and are not subject to
the annual distribution requirements under Subchapter M of the Code. Thus, there can be no assurance that we will pay any cash distributions as we may retain our earnings in certain circumstances to facilitate the growth of our business, to finance
our investments, to provide liquidity or for other corporate purposes. We have not paid dividends since 2016 and do not currently anticipate paying dividends. We may, however, re-evaluate paying dividends in
the future depending on market conditions.  We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to which shareholders may elect to have
distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock. When we declare a distribution, all participants will have credited to their plan accounts the number of full and fractional shares (computed to three decimal places) that could be
obtained with the cash, net of any applicable withholding taxes that would have been paid to them if they were not participants. The number of full and fractional shares is computed at the weighted average price of all shares of common stock
purchased for plan participants within the 30 days after the distribution is declared plus brokerage commissions. The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not release plan participants of any income tax that may be payable on the
distribution. Shareholders may terminate their participation in the dividend reinvestment plan by providing written notice to the Plan Agent at least 10 days before any given distribution payment date. Upon termination, we will issue to a
shareholder both a certificate 
  37 






for the number of full shares of common stock owned and a check for any fractional shares, valued at the then current market price, less any applicable brokerage commissions and any other costs
of sale. There are no additional fees or expenses for participation in the dividend reinvestment plan. Shareholders may obtain additional information about the dividend reinvestment plan by contacting the American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC at 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 11219.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
We did not repurchase any of our shares during the three months ended December 31, 2018. Accordingly, under our Stock Repurchase Program
previously authorized by our Board of Directors, up to 22,874,509 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program.

business activities can be found in Business.  GENERAL 
We are a finance company that has historically had a leading position in originating, acquiring, and servicing loans that finance taxicab
medallions and various types of commercial businesses. Recently, our strategic growth has been through Medallion Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary, which originates consumer loans for the purchase of RVs, boats, motorcycles, and trailers, and to
finance small-scale home improvements.  Since Medallion Bank acquired a consumer loan portfolio and began originating consumer loans in
2004, it has increased its consumer loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 16% (19% if there had been no loan sales during 2016, 2017, and 2018). We are transitioning away from medallion lending and placing our strategic focus on our
growing consumer finance business. As a result of our change in strategy, as of December 31, 2018, our consumer loans represented 77% of our loan portfolio, with medallion loans representing 16% and commercial loans representing 7%. Total
assets under management and management of

our unconsolidated wholly-owned subsidiaries (prior to April 2, 2018), which includes our managed net investment portfolio, as well as assets serviced for third party investors and
unconsolidated subsidiaries, were $1,522,000,000 as of December 31, 2018, and were $1,593,000,000 as of December 31, 2017, and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 9% from $215,000,000 at the end of 1996. 
Our loan-related earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the total yield
on our loan portfolio and the average cost of borrowed funds. We fund our operations through a wide variety of interest-bearing sources, such as revolving bank facilities, bank certificates of deposit issued to customers, debentures issued to and
guaranteed by the SBA, and bank term debt. Net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on our loan portfolio and changes in the cost of borrowed funds, as well as changes in the amount of interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing
liabilities held by us. Net interest income is also affected by economic, regulatory, and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, and the availability of funding to finance our lending activities. We, like other financial
institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-earning assets reprice on a different basis than our interest-bearing liabilities. 
We also provide debt, mezzanine, and equity investment capital to companies in a variety of industries, consistent with our investment
objectives. These investments may be venture capital style investments which may not be fully collateralized. Medallion Capitals investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by an
equity stake or warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price (such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets). Interest income is earned on the debt instruments. 
On March 7, 2018, a majority of the Companys shareholders authorized the Companys Board of Directors to withdraw the
Companys election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, and we withdrew such election effective April 2, 2018. At that point, we were no longer a BDC or subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs. Historically,
the composition of the Companys assets caused it to meet the definition of an investment company, and the Company made a corresponding election to be treated as a BDC. Now that the Company has
de-elected BDC status, it operates so as to fall outside the definition of an investment company or within an applicable exception. 
As a result of this change in status, commencing with the three months ended June 30, 2018: 
 
 

As we made this change to our financial reporting prospectively, in this report we refer to both accounting in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to bank holding companies (Bank Holding Company Accounting), which applies commencing April 2, 2018, and to that applicable to investment companies under the 1940 Act (Investment Company
Accounting), which applies to prior periods.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medallion Bank, is a bank regulated by the FDIC and the Utah
Department of Financial Institutions which originates consumer loans, raises deposits, and conducts other banking activities. Medallion Bank generally provides us with our lowest cost of funds which it raises through bank certificates of deposit. To
take advantage of this low cost of funds, historically we have referred a portion of our taxicab medallion and commercial loans to Medallion Bank, which originated these loans, and have been serviced by MSC. However, at this time Medallion Bank is
not originating any new taxi medallion loans and is working with MSC to service its existing portfolio. The FDIC restricts the amount of taxicab medallion loans that Medallion Bank may finance to three times Tier 1 capital, although it is less than
one times Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2018. MSC earns referral and servicing fees for these activities.

The assets of Taxi Medallion Loan Trust III (Trust III) were not available to pay
obligations of its affiliates or any other party. Trust IIIs loans are serviced by Medallion Funding LLC (MFC). On November 8, 2018, a limited guaranty in favor of DZ Bank was terminated in exchange for a $1.4 million note, payable
in quarterly installments over five years. As a result of such restructuring, effective as of such date, Trust III is no longer consolidated in our financial statements, and a gain of $25,325,000 was recorded in the 2018 fourth quarter reflecting
the deconsolidation.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
We follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Some of
these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The policies noted below, however, are deemed to be our critical accounting policies under the definition given to this term by
the SEC: those policies that are most important to the presentation of a companys financial condition and results of operations, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to
make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  The judgments used by management in applying the critical
accounting policies may be affected by deterioration in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. Specifically, subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may
result in significant changes to the allowance for loan losses in future periods, and the inability to collect on outstanding loans could result in increased loan losses. 
Allowance for Loan Losses 
In analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company uses historical delinquency and actual loss rates with a three-year
look-back period for medallion loans and a one-year look-back period for recreation loans and home improvement loans. The allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon
managements periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and size of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of any
underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions, and excess concentration risks. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 
Our methodology to calculate the general reserve portion of the allowance includes the use of quantitative and qualitative factors. We
initially determine an allowance based on quantitative loss factors for loans evaluated collectively for impairment. The quantitative loss factors are based primarily on historical loss rates, after considering loan type, historical loss and
delinquency experience. The quantitative loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks. Qualitative loss factors
are used to modify the reserve determined by the quantitative factors and are designed to account for losses that may not be included in the quantitative calculation according to managements best judgment. Performing loans are recorded at book
value and the general reserve maintained to absorb expected losses consistent with GAAP.  All medallion loans that reach 90 days or more
delinquent require a specific allowance reserve for those loans, which is determined on an individual basis. The allowance is then recorded so the net value of the loan is either equal to the market or collateral value of the loan. 
We charge-off loans in the period that such loans are deemed uncollectible or when they reach 120 days
delinquent regardless of whether the loan is a recreation, home improvement or medallion loan.  The methodology used in the periodic
review of reserve adequacy, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and inherent credit losses. The changes are 
  43 






reflected in both the pooled formula reserve and in specific reserves as the collectability of larger classified loans is regularly recalculated with new information as it becomes available.
Management is primarily responsible for the overall adequacy of the allowance.  Medallion Loan Collateral Valuation 
Due to the low volume of market transfer activity the taxi medallion collateral fair value is derived quarterly for each jurisdiction using
recent market transfer activity, to the extent it is available, and a discounted cash flow model. Recent market transfers published by the jurisdiction are averaged to derive the transfer activity value. When analyzing transfer activity, management
does not consider transaction outliers in the average calculation nor transactions which are confirmed through third-party sources as not arms-length. For the discounted cash flow model value, significant inputs include the discount rate, taxi
fare/lease revenue and associated expenses such as vehicle costs, fuel, credit card processing fees, repair costs, and insurance premiums. A higher discount rate, lower taxi fare/lease revenue and higher associated expenses each produce a lower fair
value. At period end, the transfer activity and discounted cash flow values create the fair value range. A weight is ascribed to each value in order to determine the final market value. 
Average Balances and Rates (Bank Holding Company Accounting) 
The following table shows the Companys consolidated average balance sheets, interest income and expense, and the average interest
earning/bearing assets and liabilities for nine months ended December 31, 2018.   

  44 





 
During the nine months, our net loans receivable had a yield of 11.73%, which
was driven by the recreation loans partly offset by the medallion loan yield driven by the market and the overall decline in the balance. The recreation loans are consumer loans used in large part to purchase recreational vehicles, boats and
trailers and the recreation loan portfolio produces the majority of our interest income. Of our debt, we use certificates of deposit to provide the funding for our consumer loans (recreation and home improvement) and a portion of our medallion
loans. In addition, due to the restructuring of the DZ loan, the overall borrowings declined, but the rate increased due to current market conditions. 
  45 





Rate/Volume Analysis (Bank Holding Company Accounting) 
The following table presents the change in interest income and expense due to changes in the average balances (volume) and average rates by
calculated for the period indicated.   
Our interest expense is driven by the interest rates payable on our bank certificates of deposit, short-term
credit facilities with banks, fixed-rate, long-term debentures issued to the SBA, and other short-term notes payable. Medallion Bank issues brokered bank certificates of deposit, which are our lowest borrowing costs. Medallion Bank is able to bid on
these deposits at a wide variety of maturity levels which allows for improved interest rate management strategies.  Our cost of funds is
primarily driven by the rates paid on our various debt instruments and their relative mix, and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of our outstanding
debt. Our debentures issued to the SBA typically have terms of ten years. 
  46 





We measure our borrowing costs as our aggregate interest expense for all of our
interest-bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period. The following tables show the average borrowings and related borrowing costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our
average balances decreased during the current year, reflecting the contraction in the loan portfolios, mainly due to the deconsolidation of Trust III and the consumer loan sale in the third quarter of 2018. The increase in borrowing costs primarily
reflected the repricing of term borrowings based upon the current market and increased deposit balances reflecting a lengthening of their maturity profile.   
 
We will continue to seek SBA funding through
Medallion Capital to the extent it offers attractive rates. SBA financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur. We use SBA funding to fund loans that qualify under the SBIA and SBA regulations. We
believe that financing operations primarily with short-term floating rate secured bank debt has generally decreased our interest expense, but has also increased our exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates, which we mitigate with
certain interest rate strategies. At December 31, 2018 short-term adjustable rate debt constituted 6% of total debt, and 
  47 






were 55% (15% on a managed basis which included borrowings of our consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries) and 59% (16% on a managed basis) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
Provision and Allowance for Loan Loss (Bank Holding Company Accounting) 
The below is based upon activity beginning on April 2, 2018. During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, the New York medallion
value slightly decreased to a net realizable value of $181,000, from $183,500 at March 31, 2018 and in the 2018 fourth quarter, the net realizable value of the other markets declined as loans continue to age over 120 days. The provision was
slightly improved by the deconsolidation of Trust III in the 2018 fourth quarter, leading to a reversal of $8,161,000 of provision. The provision also included $5,708,000 of a general reserve, for the Company, for current and performing medallion
loans under 90 days past due, as an additional buffer against future losses. This figure excludes the general reserve of $17,351,000 at the Bank, which was netted against loan balances at consolidation on April 2, 2018.

The following table presents the allowance by segment as a percent of loans as of
December 31, 2018 under Bank Holding Company Accounting.   
The following tables set forth the pre-tax changes in our unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) on investments, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 under Investment Company Accounting. 
 
Under both Bank Holding Company Accounting and Investment Company Accounting, we generally follow a practice
of discontinuing the accrual of interest income on our loans that are in arrears as to payments for a 
  49 






period of 90 days or more. We deliver a default notice and begin foreclosure and liquidation proceedings when management determines that pursuit of these remedies is the most appropriate course
of action under the circumstances. A loan is considered to be delinquent if the borrower fails to make a payment on time; however, during the course of discussion on delinquent status, we may agree to modify the payment terms of the loan with a
borrower that cannot make payments in accordance with the original loan agreement. For loan modifications, the loan will only be returned to accrual status if all past due interest and principal payments are brought fully current. For credit that is
collateral based, we evaluate the anticipated net residual value we would receive upon foreclosure of such loans, if necessary. There can be no assurance, however, that the collateral securing these loans will be adequate in the event of
foreclosure. For credit that is cash flow-based, we assess our collateral position, and evaluate most of these relationships as ongoing businesses, expecting to locate and install a new operator to run the business and reduce the debt. 
For the consumer loan portfolio, the process to repossess the collateral is started at 60 days past due. If the collateral is not located and
the account reaches 120 days delinquent, the account is charged-off to realized losses. If the collateral is repossessed, a realized loss is recorded to write the collateral down to its net realizable value,
and the collateral is sent to auction. When the collateral is sold, the net auction proceeds are applied to the account, and any remaining balance is written off as a realized loss, and any excess proceeds are recorded as a realized gain. Proceeds
collected on charged-off accounts are recorded as realized gains. All collection, repossession, and recovery efforts are handled on behalf of Medallion Bank by the servicer.

SEGMENT RESULTS 
We manage our financial results under four operating segments and report like a bank holding company. The segments are recreation lending, home
improvement lending, commercial lending, and medallion lending. We also show results for two non-operating segments; RPAC and corporate and other investments. Prior to April 2, 2018, we operated as one
segment. All results are for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.  Recreation Lending 
The recreation lending segment is a high-growth prime and non-prime consumer finance business which is
a significant source of income for us, accounting for 71% of our interest income for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. In September 2018, we sold of $55,979,000 of recreation loans for a gain of $3,093,000, included in non-interest income (expense). Recreation loans are secured primarily by RVs and boats, with RV loans making up 59% of the portfolio and boat loans making up 18% of the portfolio at the end of the period. Recreation
loans are made to borrowers residing in all fifty states, with the highest concentrations in Texas, California, and Florida, at 18%, 11%, and 10% of loans outstanding, respectively, and with no other states over 10%. 
  53 





The following table presents as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
 
 

Home Improvement Lending 
The home improvement lending segment works with contractors and financial service providers to finance residential home improvements and is
concentrated in swimming pools, solar panels, roofs, and windows at 31%, 16%, 15%, and 11% of total loans outstanding, with no other collateral types over 10%. Home improvement loans are made to borrowers residing in all fifty states, with the
highest concentrations in Texas, Florida, Ohio, and California at 15%, 11%, 9%, and 9% of loans outstanding, respectively, and with no other states over 10%. In September 2018, we sold $44,909,000 of home improvement loans for a gain of $2,079,000,
included in non-interest income (expense). 
  54 





The following table presents as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
 
 

Commercial Lending  We
originate both senior and subordinated loans nationwide to businesses in a variety of industries, more than 51% of which are located in the Midwest and Northeast regions, with the rest scattered across the country. These mezzanine loans are
primarily secured by a second position on all assets of the businesses and generally range in amount from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 at origination, and typically included an equity component as part of the financing. The commercial lending business
has concentrations in manufacturing; professional, scientific, and technical services; and transportation and warehousing; and wholesale trade making up 48%, 14%, 9% and 9% of total business. 
  55 





The following table presents as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
 
 

 
 

Medallion Lending  The
medallion lending segment operates mainly in the New York, Newark, and Chicago markets. We have a long history of owning, managing, and financing taxicab fleets, taxicab medallions, and corporate car services. For the nine months ended December 31,
2018, we have seen a leveling off in the medallion values of the New York market, while in the other markets there has been a decline in values. Additionally, we have also continued to see a decline in interest income due to loans aging greater than
90 days and being placed on nonaccrual. During the 2018 fourth quarter, 
  56 






we deconsolidated Trust III which led to a gain of $25,325,000. Additionally, we continued removing underperforming loans from the portfolio by transferring to loan collateral in process of
foreclosure, or charge-offs. All the loans are secured by the medallions and enhanced by personal guarantees of the shareholders and owners. 
The following table presents as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. 
 
 

 
RPAC 
We are the majority owner and managing member of RPAC Racing, LLC, a performance and marketing company for NASCAR. Revenues are mainly earned
through sponsorships and race winning activity over the nine month race season (February through November) during the year.

The following table presents as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
 
Corporate and Other Investments 
This non-operating segment relates to our equity and investment securities as well as other assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses not allocated to the other main operating segments. This activity also includes the elimination of all intercompany activity amongst the entities. 
The following table presents as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. 
 
Trends in Investment Portfolio under Investment Company Accounting 
Our investment income is driven by the principal amount of and yields on our investment portfolio. To identify trends in the balances and
yields, the following table illustrates our investments at fair value, grouped by 
  58 






medallion loans, commercial loans, equity investments, and investment securities, and also presents the portfolio information for Medallion Bank, at the dates indicated.

PORTFOLIO SUMMARY (Investment Company Accounting) 
Total Portfolio Yield  The
weighted average yield (which is calculated by dividing the aggregate yield of each investment in the portfolio by the aggregate portfolio balance and does not include expenses and sales load for any offering) of the total managed portfolio under
Investment Company Accounting at March 31, 2018 was 10.96%, an increase of 35 basis points from 10.61% at December 31, 2017 and an increase of 146 basis points from 9.50% at December 31, 2016. 
Medallion Loan Portfolio 
Our managed medallion loans of $318,864,000 comprised 23% of the net managed portfolio of $1,386,136,000 at March 31, 2018, compared to
28% of the net managed portfolio of $1,380,054,000 at December 31, 2017 and 35% the net managed portfolio of $1,517,592,000 at December 31, 2016. The medallion loan portfolio decreased by $69,137,000 or 18% on a managed basis from
December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 primarily reflecting increased realized and unrealized losses and net amortization of loan principal, especially in the New York, Boston, and Chicago markets. 
The weighted average yield of the managed medallion loan portfolio at March 31, 2018 was 4.42%, an increase of 6 basis points from 4.36%
at December 31, 2017, and an increase of 48 basis points from 3.88% at December 31, 2016. The fluctuation in yield primarily reflected the repricing of the existing portfolio to current market interest rates. At March 31, 2018, 15% of
the managed medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside New York, compared to 19% and 24% at December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
Commercial Loan Portfolio 
Our commercial loans represented 7%, 7% and 6% of the net managed investment portfolio as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and
2016. Commercial loans increased by $4,986,000 or 5% on a managed basis from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 primarily reflecting the growth in the mezzanine loan portfolio. 
The weighted average yield of the managed commercial loan portfolio at March 31, 2018 was 11.76%, a decrease of 9 basis points from
11.85% at December 31, 2017, and a decrease of 100 basis points from 12.76% at December 31, 2016. The decreases primarily reflected the recent lower rates on certain of the mezzanine loans. 
  60 





Consumer Loan Portfolio 
Medallion Bank originates fixed rate consumer loans secured by recreational vehicles, boats, trailers, and home improvements located in all 50
states. Our managed consumer loans, represented 52%, 49% and 46% of the managed net investment portfolio as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
The weighted average gross yield of the managed consumer loan portfolio was 14.86% at March 31, 2018, compared to 15.02% at
December 31, 2017 and 14.27% at December 31, 2016. The change in yield primarily reflects the changes in the loans originated. 
Investment in Medallion Bank and Other Controlled Subsidiaries 
As an investment company prior to April 2, 2018, our investment in Medallion Bank was previously subject to quarterly assessments of fair
value. We conducted a thorough valuation analysis, and determined whether any factors give rise to a valuation different than recorded book value, including various regulatory restrictions that were established at Medallion Banks inception, by
the FDIC and State of Utah, and also by additional marketplace restrictions, such as the ability to transfer industrial bank charters. Because of these restrictions and other factors, our Board of Directors had previously determined that Medallion
Bank had little value beyond its recorded book value. As a result of this valuation process, we had previously used Medallion Banks actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value, and recorded the results as a
component of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. In the 2015 second quarter, we first became aware of external interest in Medallion Bank and its portfolio assets at values in excess of their book value. Expression of interest in
Medallion Bank from both investment bankers and interested parties has continued. We incorporated these new factors in the Medallion Banks fair value analysis and the Board of Directors determined that Medallion Bank had a fair value in excess
of book value. In addition, in the 2016 third quarter there was a court ruling involving a marketplace lender that we believe heightens the interest of marketplace lenders to acquire or merge with Utah industrial banks. We also engaged a valuation
specialist to assist the Board of Directors in its determination of Medallion Banks fair value, and this appreciation of $15,500,000 was thereby recorded in 2015, and additional appreciation of $128,918,000 was recorded in 2016, $7,849,000 was
recorded in 2017, and $39,826,000 was recorded in the first quarter of 2018.  Consolidated Results of Operations 
For the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2018 under Bank Holding Company Accounting 
Net loss attributable to shareholders was $10,172,000 or $0.42 per diluted common share for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. 
Total interest income was $96,803,000 in for the nine months. The yield on interest earning assets was 10.98% for the nine months. Average
interest earning assets were $1,170,612,000 for the nine months.  Loans before allowance for loan losses were $1,017,882,000 as of
December 31, 2018, and were comprised of recreation ($587,038,000), home improvement ($183,155,000), medallion ($183,606,000) and commercial ($64,083,000) loans. The Company had an allowance for loan losses as of the end of the year 2018 of
$36,395,000, which was attributable to the medallion (76%), recreation (19%), and home improvement (5%) loan portfolios. Loans declined from $1,095,780,000 at April 2, 2018 primarily due to the deconsolidation of Trust III of $53,545,740 in
medallion loans, along with continued charge-offs, reserve increases, and principal repayments. These decreases were partially offset by net loan originations in which a majority related to the recreation segment. The provision for loan losses was
$59,008,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, reflecting losses throughout the entire loan portfolio and included a non-specific general reserve for medallion loans of $5,708,000. See Note 4
for additional information on loans and the allowance for loan losses.  Interest expense was $24,816,000 for the nine months and the cost
of borrowed funds was 2.79%. Average debt outstanding was $1,181,323,000. See page 47 for a table which shows average balances and cost of funds for our funding sources. 
  61 





Net interest income was $71,987,000 and the net interest margin was 8.19% for the nine
months ended.  Noninterest income, which is mainly comprised of sponsorship and race winnings at RPAC, late charges, write-downs of loan
collateral, impairment of equity investments and other miscellaneous income, was $41,946,000 for the nine months. The activity also included the gain on the deconsolidation of Trust III of $25,325,000. 
Operating expenses were $62,081,000 for the nine months. Salaries and benefits expense was $19,357,000 for the period, professional fees were
$8,609,000, primarily reflecting legal costs for a variety of corporate and investment-related matters, race team costs were $7,121,000, loan servicing costs were $3,470,000, primarily reflecting the cost of servicing the recreation and home
improvement consumer loans, and occupancy and other operating expenses were $17,909,000. In addition, impairment on goodwill of $5,615,000 was recorded in the nine months. 
Total income tax expense was $709,000 for the nine months. See Note 8 for more information. 
Loan collateral in process of foreclosure was $49,495,000 at December 31, 2018, an increase from $21,749,000 at April 2, 2018. The
increase primarily reflected the re-classification of $31,099,000 from nonperforming loans shown as investments in the 2018 first quarter and the net increase in loans that reached 120 days past due and
were charged down to collateral value and reclassified to loans in process of foreclosure, partially offset by the deconsolidation of Trust III, the writedowns of collateral values and the cash received in settlement of these assets. 
Goodwill and intangible assets were $204,785,000 at December 31, 2018, which arose as a result of election to no longer report as a BDC
as of April 2, 2018 and was in connection with the consolidation of Medallion Bank and RPAC. See Note 2 for further information regarding goodwill and intangible assets. 
2018 First Quarter under Investment Company Accounting 
Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was $14,874,000 or $0.62 per diluted common share in the 2018 first quarter primarily
reflecting an increase in net realized/unrealized losses on the investment portfolio, increased operating expenses and higher income taxes. Net investment loss after income taxes was $3,230,000 or $0.13 per share in the 2018 quarter. 
Investment income was $4,033,000 in the 2018 first quarter and included $1,643,000 of interest reversals related to nonaccrual loans in 2018.
The yield on the investment portfolio was 2.69% in the 2018 quarter.  Interest expense was $3,551,000 in the 2018 first quarter. The
increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased borrowing costs. The cost of borrowed funds was 4.44% in 2018 reflecting the continuing increase in market interest rates. Average debt outstanding was $324,322,000 for the 2018 quarter
primarily reflecting decreased borrowings required to fund the contracting loan portfolio.  Net interest income was $482,000 and the net
interest margin was 0.32% for the 2018 quarter.  Noninterest income, which is comprised of prepayment fees, servicing fee income, late
charges, and other miscellaneous income, was $60,000 in the 2018 quarter primarily reflecting the reversal of a previously earned management fee due from a portfolio company in the prior year quarter. 
Operating expenses were $4,108,000 in the 2018 first quarter. Salaries and benefits expense was $2,349,000 in the 2018 quarter primarily due
to executive and employee bonus accrual. Professional fees were $723,000 in 2018 primarily reflecting higher legal expenses for a variety of corporate and investment-related matters. Occupancy and other operating expenses of $1,036,000 in 2018
primarily reflecting higher road or miscellaneous taxes, collection costs related to the medallion loan portfolio and directors fees.

Total income tax benefit was $640,000 in 2018, and was comprised of three components, a
$336,000 benefit related to the net investment loss, an $8,426,000 benefit related to realized losses, and a provision of $8,122,000 related to net unrealized gains on investments. 
Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments before income tax was appreciation of $22,797,000 in the 2018 first
quarter. Net change in unrealized appreciation other than the portion related to Medallion Bank and the other controlled subsidiaries, was depreciation of $6,318,000 in 2018, resulting in decreased depreciation of $2,205,000 and related almost
entirely to the medallion portfolio. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) arises when we make valuation adjustments to the investment portfolio. When investments are sold or written off, any resulting realized gain (loss) is grossed up to reflect
previously recorded unrealized components. As a result, movement between periods can appear distorted. The current quarter activity resulted from net appreciation on Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries of $29,115,000 and by reversals of
unrealized depreciation on loans which were charged-off of $34,747,000, offset by unrealized depreciation on loans and other investments of $40,067,000 mainly due to the continuing declining values of the
medallions.  Our net realized losses on investments before taxes were $34,745,000 in the 2018 quarter. The 2018 activity reflected the
realized losses in the loan portfolio.  Our net realized/unrealized loss on investments before income taxes was $11,948,000 in the 2018
first quarter reflecting the above.  For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 under Investment Company Accounting 
Net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $278,000 or $0.01 per diluted common share in 2017, down $23,237,000 or 99% from
$23,515,000 or $0.97 per share in 2016, primarily reflecting an increase in net realized/unrealized losses on the investment portfolio and lower net interest income, partially offset by an increased income tax benefit and lower operating expenses.
Net investment loss after income taxes was $7,121,000 or $0.30 per share in 2017, down $7,240,000 from income of $119,000 or less than $0.01 in 2016. 
Investment income was $19,624,000 in 2017, down $5,464,000 or 22% from $25,088,000 a year ago, and included in 2017 and 2016 were $1,278,000
and $3,000,000 in dividends from Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries. The decrease was also due to $5,514,000 of interest forgone in 2017, compared to $2,634,000 in 2016. The yield on the investment portfolio was 3.12% in 2017, down 25%
from was 4.17% in 2016. Excluding the dividends, the 2017 yield was down 20% to 2.92% from 3.67% in 2016, reflecting the above. Average investments outstanding were $629,089,000 in 2017, up 4% from $602,349,000 in the prior year primarily reflecting
growth in the commercial portfolio and subsidiary investments.  Medallion loans were $208,279,000 at year end, down $58,537,000 or 22%
from $266,816,000 a year ago, representing 34% of the investment portfolio, compared to 41% a year ago, and were yielding 4.41% compared to 4.01% a year ago. The decrease in outstandings was primarily concentrated in the New York and Chicago
markets, although all markets declined, and was primarily attributable to realized losses recognized and net amortization of loan principal. The managed medallion portfolio, which includes loans at Medallion Bank and those serviced for third
parties, was $414,350,000 at year end, down $139,089,000 or 25% from $553,439,000 a year ago, reflecting the above, and realized losses taken and principal amortization at Medallion Bank. The commercial loan portfolio was $90,188,000 at year end,
compared to $83,634,000 a year ago, an increase of $6,554,000 or 8%, and represented 15% of the investment portfolio compared to 13% a year ago. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in the secured mezzanine portfolio, partially
offset by decreases in other secured commercial loans. Commercial loans yielded 12.02% at year end, down 8% from 13.05% a year ago, reflecting lower yields on certain recent loans. The net managed commercial loan portfolio, which includes loans at
Medallion Bank and those serviced for or by third parties, was $92,530,000 at year end, up $4,686,000 or 5% from $87,844,000 a year ago, reflecting the above. Investments in Medallion Bank and other controlled

  63 






subsidiaries were $302,147,000 at year end, up $8,787,000 or 3% from $293,360,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting the appreciation and equity in the earnings of Medallion Bank other portfolio
company investments, capital contributions made, dividends paid, portfolio sales, and the net valuation adjustment, and which represented 49% of the investment portfolio at the end of 2017 and 45% in the prior year, and which yielded 0.83% at year
end, compared to 2.13% a year ago, primarily reflecting reduced dividends from Medallion Bank. Equity investments were $9,521,000 at year end, up $1,053,000 or 12% from $8,468,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting increase in investments held, and
which represented 2% of the investment portfolio at the end of 2017 and 1% in the prior year, and had a dividend yield of 0% in both years. 
Interest expense was $13,770,000 in 2017, up $1,132,000 or 9% from $12,638,000 in 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to
increased borrowing costs on floating rate borrowings. The cost of borrowed funds was 4.12% in 2017, compared to 3.32% a year ago, an increase of 24%, reflecting the recent increases in market interest rates. Average debt outstanding was
$334,022,000 in 2017, compared to $380,305,000 a year ago, down 12%, primarily reflecting decreased borrowings required to fund the contracting medallion loan portfolio. See page 47 for a table that shows average balances and cost of funds for
our funding sources.  Net interest income was $5,854,000 and the net interest margin was 0.93% in 2017, down $6,596,000 or 53% from
$12,450,000 a year ago, which represented a net interest margin of 2.07%, all reflecting the items discussed above.  Noninterest income,
which is comprised of prepayment fees, management fees, servicing fee income, late charges, and other miscellaneous income was $107,000 in 2017, down $301,000 or 74% from $408,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting lower management and other fees
generated from the portfolios.  Operating expenses were $13,810,000 in 2017, down $8,976,000 or 39% from $22,786,000 in 2016 which
included a $5,099,000 goodwill write off. Salaries and benefits expense was $7,508,000 in the year, down $4,262,000 or 36% from $11,770,000 in 2016 primarily due to a reduction in bonus costs recorded in the current period and lower salary expenses
due to the sale of its asset-based lending division in the prior year. Professional fees were $2,619,000 in 2017, up $272,000 or 12% from $2,347,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting higher legal and other professional fee expenses for a variety of
corporate and investment-related matters. Occupancy expense was $1,069,000 in 2017, up $103,000 or 11% from $966,000 in 2016, primarily reflecting annual increases in rent expense at various locations. Other operating expenses of $2,614,000 in 2017
were down $10,000 from $2,604,000 a year ago reflecting decreased travel and entertainment expenses, directors fees, miscellaneous taxes and reduced expense reimbursements, partially offset by increases in collection and other expenses. 
Total income tax benefit was $36,226,000 in 2017 compared to income tax expense of $45,900,000 in 2016, a change of $82,126,000. Total taxes
were comprised of three components, a $728,000 benefit related net investment loss compared to $10,047,000 in 2016, benefits related to realized losses and unrealized appreciation on investments of $15,955,000 and $19,543,000, compared to provisions
of $384,000 and $55,563,000 in 2016. The tax benefit recorded in 2017 reflected the $17,279,000 for adjustment to implement the change in U.S. tax law rates on the net tax liabilities. See Note 8 for more information. 
Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments was $15,645,000 in 2017, compared to $78,886,000 in 2016, a decrease in appreciation of
$63,241,000. Net change in unrealized appreciation other than the portion related to Medallion Bank and the other controlled subsidiaries, was appreciation of $6,162,000 in 2017 compared to a depreciation of $51,235,000 in 2016, resulting in
increased appreciation of $57,397,000 in 2017. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) arises when we make valuation adjustments to the investment portfolio. When investments are sold or written off, any resulting realized gain (loss) is grossed up
to reflect previously recorded unrealized components. As a result, movement between periods can appear distorted. The 2017 activity resulted from a net appreciation on Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries of $9,483,000, reversals of

  64 






unrealized depreciation associated with charged-off loans of $46,795,000, partially offset by unrealized depreciation on loans of $37,745,000, the reversal
of unrealized appreciation on investments that were exited with a realized gain of $3,082,000, unrealized depreciation on investments other than securities and other assets of $2,075,000, and net unrealized appreciation on equity investments of
$2,269,000. The 2016 activity resulted from net appreciation on Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries of $130,121,000 and by reversals of unrealized depreciation associated with charged-off loans of
$3,486,000, partially offset by unrealized depreciation on loans of $27,710,000, investments other than securities of $28,372,000, and net unrealized appreciation on investment securities of $1,367,000. The net appreciation on Medallion Bank and
other controlled subsidiaries described above is net of the dividends declared by them to us of $1,278,000 in 2017 and $3,000,000 in 2016. 
Our net realized losses on investments were $43,744,000 in 2017 compared to gains of $457,000 in 2016, an increase in realized losses of
$44,201,000 in 2017. The 2017 activity reflected the reversals described in the unrealized paragraph above, other gain on the liquidation of other investment securities of $4,684,000, and net loan charge-offs of $4,715,000, inclusive of losses on
equity investments. The 2016 activity reflected the reversals described in the unrealized paragraph above, and other net loan charge-offs of $224,000, partially offset by gains of $2,111,000 from the sale of investment securities and $2,057,000 from
the sale of the asset-based lending portfolio.  Our net realized/unrealized gains on investments were $7,399,000 in 2017, compared to
$23,396,000 in 2016, a decrease of $15,997,000 or 68% of net gains in the year, reflecting the above.  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 
Interest Rate Sensitivity  We, like other
financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest-earning assets (consisting of medallion, commercial, and consumer loans, and investment securities) reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to our
interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of credit facilities with banks and other lenders, bank certificates of deposit, and SBA debentures). 
Having interest-bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining
interest rates, although such an asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates. Abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to
originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates. Conversely, having interest-earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates, although this
asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates. This mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities results in
interest rate risk.  The effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio. Based on past experience,
we anticipate that approximately 40% of the taxicab medallion portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year. We believe that the average life of our loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates. Borrowers are more
likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrowers loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates. Conversely, borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising
interest rate environment. However, borrowers may prepay for a variety of other reasons, such as to monetize increases in the underlying collateral values, particularly in the medallion loan portfolio. 
In addition, we manage our exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed-rate indebtedness, such as ten year
subordinated SBA debentures, and by setting repricing intervals on certificates of deposit, for terms of up to five years. We had outstanding SBA debentures of $80,099,000 with a weighted 
  65 






average interest rate of 3.40%, constituting 7% of our total indebtedness, and retail notes of $33,625,000, with a weighted average interest rate of 9.00%, constituting 3% of total indebtedness
as of December 31, 2018. Also, as of December 31, 2018, certain of the certificates of deposit were for terms of up to 55 months, further mitigating the immediate impact of changes in market interest rates. 
A relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from our interest rate sensitivity gap. The interest rate sensitivity gap represents
the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which mature and/or reprice within specified intervals of time. The gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities, and
negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets. A relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval
expressed as a percentage of total assets.  The following table presents our interest rate sensitivity gap at December 31, 2018. The
principal amounts of interest earning assets are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be repriced. We have not reflected an assumed annual prepayment rate for such assets in this table. 
 
 


Our interest rate sensitive assets were $1,121,861,000 and interest rate sensitive liabilities were $1,062,028,000 at
December 31, 2018. The one-year cumulative interest rate gap was a negative $232,323,000 or 21% of interest rate sensitive assets. However, using our estimated 40% prepayment/refinancing rate for
medallion loans to adjust the interest rate gap resulted in a negative gap of $210,284,000 or 19% at December 31, 2018. We seek to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable-rate loans, by incurring fixed-rate indebtedness, by
evaluating appropriate derivatives, pursuing securitization opportunities, and by other options consistent with managing interest rate risk. 
  66 





Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Our sources of liquidity are with a variety of local and regional banking institutions, unfunded commitments to sell debentures to the SBA,
loan amortization and prepayments, private issuances of debt securities, participations or sales of loans to third parties, the disposition of other assets of the Company, and dividends from Medallion Bank, although we have not received any since
2016 and are subject to compliance with regulatory ratios, and Medallion Capital. Additionally, there were $3,000,000 of unfunded commitments from the SBA as of December 31, 2018. 
Additionally, Medallion Bank has access to independent sources of funds for our business originated there, primarily through brokered
certificates of deposit. Medallion Bank has $45,000,000 available under Fed Funds lines with several commercial banks. In addition, Medallion Bank can retain earnings in its business to fund future growth. 
The components of our debt were as follows at December 31, 2018. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the
contractual terms of our borrowings.   
 

Our contractual obligations expire on or mature at various dates through September 2037. The following table shows all contractual obligations
at December 31, 2018.   
Most of our borrowing relationships have maturity dates during 2019 through 2021. We have been in active and
ongoing discussions with each of these lenders and have extended each of the facilities as they matured. The lenders have worked with us to extend and change the terms of the borrowing agreements. We have arranged for changes to the terms of the
notes and payment and borrowing base calculations which we anticipate will facilitate our operations for the foreseeable future.  In
addition, the illiquidity of portions of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of them at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In

  67 






addition, if we were required to liquidate some or all of our portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we borrow
money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in
market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which would reduce our net interest income. We use a combination of long-term and
short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with short-term floating-rate debt, and to a lesser extent by term fixed-rate debt. We may use interest rate
risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no
actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity a hypothetical immediate 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to the line item net income as of December 31, 2018 by $549,000 on an annualized basis, and
the impact of such an immediate increase of 1% over a one year period would have been ($1,012,000) at December 31, 2018. Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not
adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet, and other business developments that could affect net income from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole.
Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates. 
We continue to work with investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries to investigate the viability of a number of other
financing options which include, among others, the sale or spinoff of certain assets or divisions, the development of a securitization conduit program, and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes. These financing
options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth. 
  68 





The following table illustrates sources of available funds for us and each of our
subsidiaries, and amounts outstanding under credit facilities and their respective end of period weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2018. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about each
credit facility.   
 

Loan amortization, prepayments, and sales also provide a source of funding for us. Prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by
general interest rates, medallion loan market values, economic conditions, and competition.  We also generate liquidity through deposits
generated at Medallion Bank, borrowing arrangements with other banks, and through the issuance of SBA debentures, as well as from cash flow from operations. In addition, we may choose to participate a greater portion of our loan portfolio to third
parties. We are actively seeking additional sources of liquidity, however, given current market conditions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional liquidity on terms favorable to us or at all. If that occurs, we may decline
to underwrite lower yielding loans in order to conserve capital until credit conditions in the market become more favorable; or we may be required to dispose of assets when we would not otherwise do so, and at prices which may be below the net book
value of such assets in order for us to repay indebtedness on a timely basis.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure
Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value. The objective of this update is to modify the disclosure requirements as it relates to the fair value of assets and liabilities. The amendments in this update are

  69 






effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not believe this update will have a material impact on our financial
condition.  In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles  Goodwill and
Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The objective of this update is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments in this update are
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not believe this update will have a material impact on our financial condition. 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses
(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The main objective of this new standard is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial assets and
other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The aftermath of the global economic crisis and the delayed recognition of credit losses associated with loans (and other financial instruments) was identified as
a weakness in the application of existing accounting standards. Specifically, because the existing incurred loss model delays recognition until it is probable a credit loss was incurred, the FASB explored alternatives that would use more
forward-looking information. Under the FASBs new standard, the concepts used by entities to account for credit losses on financial instruments will fundamentally change. The existing probable and incurred loss
recognition threshold is removed. Loss estimates are based upon lifetime expected credit losses. The use of past and current events must now be supplemented with reasonable and supportable expectations about the future to
determine the amount of credit loss. The collective changes to the recognition and measurement accounting standards for financial instruments and their anticipated impact on the allowance for credit losses modeling have been universally referred to
as the CECL (current expected credit loss) model. ASU 2016-13 applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 for public entities and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 for all other entities, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the impact the update will have on our financial statements and expects the update to have a significant impact on how we
will account for estimated credit losses on our loans.  In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for leases classified as
operating under GAAP. ASU 2016-02 applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 for public entities. We have assessed the impact the update
will have on our financial condition and determined that effective January 1, 2019 a right-of-use asset and a lease liability each of $13,997,000 would be recorded, and accrued/amortized over the remaining lease life terms. See Note 12 for
additional information.   

Our business activities contain elements of risk. We consider the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio
valuations. We consider the management of risk essential to conducting our businesses. Accordingly, our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risks, to set appropriate policies and limits, and to continually
monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs.  In addition,
the illiquidity of portions of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of them at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In addition, if we were required to
liquidate some or all of our portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we borrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the
difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest
income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which would reduce our net interest income. We use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report. As a result of this evaluation, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
As required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the 2018 fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting, and have concluded that there have been no changes that occurred during the 2018 fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:   
 

 
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Our management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment and those criteria, management believes that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. 
We believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly represent our consolidated financial position and
consolidated results of operations for all periods presented.  Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Mazars USA LLP, has
audited and issued a report on managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of Mazars USA LLP appears below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Medallion Financial Corp. 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  We
have audited Medallion Financial Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework:
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.  We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Medallion Financial Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31,
2018 and 2017, including the consolidated summary schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, other comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity and changes in
net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and schedules listed in the index to the financial statements and in Item 15(A)3 as Exhibit 99.1, and selected
financial ratios and other data (see note 16) for each of the four years in the four-year period ended December 31, 2017 of the Company, and our report dated March 13, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion. 
Basis for Opinion  The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Definition and Limitations of
Internal Control over Financial Reporting  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. 
  73 





Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may
deteriorate.  /s/ Mazars USA LLP  New York, New York

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Medallion Financial Corp. 
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Financial Ratios and Other Data 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Medallion Financial Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31,
2018 and 2017, including the consolidated summary schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, other comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity and changes in
net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and schedules listed in the index to the financial statements and in Item 15(A)3 as Exhibit 99.1, and selected
financial ratios and other data (see note 16) for each of the four years in the four-year period ended December 31, 2017 (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements and selected financial ratios and other
data). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and selected financial ratios and other data present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of
its operations, changes in stockholders equity and net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the selected financial ratios and other data for each of the four years in the
four-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 13, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Change in Accounting Principle 
As further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and selected financial ratios and other data, the Company withdrew its previous
election to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, effective April 2, 2018. The Company is not deemed to be an investment company under generally accepted accounting principles as of
April 2, 2018, and therefore the Company no longer follows Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification Topic 946, Financial Services  Investment Companies, and applies other generally accepted accounting
principles for finance companies since that date.  Basis for Opinion 
These consolidated financial statements and selected financial ratios and other data are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and selected financial ratios and other data based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements and selected financial ratios and other data are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and selected financial ratios and other data, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts 
  






and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and selected financial ratios and other data. Our procedures included physical inspection or confirmation of securities owned as of
December 31, 2017, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies were not received. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements and selected financial ratios and other data. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
DECEMBER 31, 2018  (1)
ORGANIZATION OF MEDALLION FINANCIAL CORP. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES  Medallion Financial Corp. (the Company) is a finance company organized
as a Delaware corporation that reports as a bank holding company, but is not a bank holding company for regulatory purposes. The Company conducts its business through various wholly-owned subsidiaries including its primary operating company,
Medallion Bank (the Bank), a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured industrial bank, that originates consumer loans, raises deposits, and conducts other banking activities. Medallion Bank is subject to competition from other financial
institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies, and undergoes examinations by those agencies. Medallion Bank was initially formed for the primary purpose of originating commercial loans in three categories: 1) loans to
finance the purchase of taxicab medallions, 2) asset-based commercial loans, and 3) SBA 7(a) loans. The loans are marketed and serviced by Medallion Banks affiliates that have extensive prior experience in these asset groups. Subsequent to its
formation, Medallion Bank began originating consumer loans to finance the purchases of recreational vehicles (RVs), boats, and other related items, and to finance small scale home improvements. The Company also conducts business through Medallion
Funding LLC (MFC), a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) which originates and services taxicab medallion and commercial loans.  The
Company also conducts business through its subsidiaries Medallion Capital, Inc. (MCI), an SBIC which conducts a mezzanine financing business, and Freshstart Venture Capital Corp. (FSVC), an SBIC which originates and services taxicab medallion and
commercial loans. MFC, MCI, and FSVC, as SBICs, are regulated by the Small Business Administration (SBA). MCI and FSVC are financed in part by the SBA. 
The Company has a controlling ownership stake in Medallion Motorsports, LLC, the primary owner of RPAC Racing, LLC (RPAC), a professional car
racing team that competes in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, which is also consolidated with the Company.  The Company formed a
wholly-owned subsidiary, Medallion Servicing Corporation (MSC), to provide loan services to Medallion Bank. The Company has assigned all of its loan servicing rights for Medallion Bank, which consists of servicing taxi medallion loans originated by
Medallion Bank, to MSC, which bills and collects the related service fee income from Medallion Bank, and is allocated and charged by the Company for MSCs share of these servicing costs. 
Taxi Medallion Loan Trust III (Trust III) was established for the purpose of owning medallion loans originated by MFC or others. Trust III is
a variable interest entity (VIE), and MFC was the primary beneficiary and as a result the Company consolidated Trust III in its financial results until consummation of a restructuring in the 2018 fourth quarter. For a discussion of the
restructuring, see Note 23. Trust III is a separate legal and corporate entity with its own creditors which, in any liquidation of Trust III, will be entitled to be satisfied out of Trust IIIs assets prior to any value in Trust III becoming
available to Trust IIIs equity holders. The assets of Trust III are not available to pay obligations of its affiliates or any other party, and the assets of affiliates or any other party are not available to pay obligations of Trust III. Trust
IIIs loans are serviced by MFC.  The Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Medallion Financing Trust I (Fin Trust) for the
purpose of issuing unsecured preferred securities to investors. Fin Trust is a separate legal and corporate entity with its own creditors who, in any liquidation of Fin Trust, will be entitled to be satisfied out of Fin Trusts assets prior to
any value in Fin Trust becoming available to Fin Trusts equity holders. The assets of Fin Trust, aggregating $36,141,000 at December 31, 2018, are not available to pay obligations of its affiliates or any other party, and the assets of
affiliates or any other party are not available to pay obligations of Fin Trust.  MFC, through several wholly-owned subsidiaries
(together, Medallion Chicago), purchased $8,689,000 of City of Chicago taxicab medallions out of foreclosure, which are leased to fleet operators while being held for 
  






sale. The 159 medallions are carried at a net realizable value of $4,305,000 on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 compared to fair value of $7,450,000 at
December 31, 2017.  (2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Change to Bank Holding Company Accounting 
Effective April 2, 2018, the Company withdrew its previous election to be regulated as a business development company (BDC) under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act). Prior to such time, the Company was a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that had elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940
Act. Accordingly, commencing with the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company (which now consolidates the results of Medallion Bank and its other subsidiaries) reports in accordance with Bank Holding Company Accounting; periods prior to
such change in status are reported in accordance with Investment Company Accounting. Significant accounting policies that differ between such periods are described in more detail below. 
Use of Estimates  The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
the accompanying notes. Accounting estimates and assumptions are those that management considers to be the most critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and
uncertainties. All of these estimates reflect managements best judgment about current economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. If such conditions
change, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change, which may result in future impairments of loans and loans in process of foreclosure, goodwill and intangible assets, and investments, among other effects. 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries commencing
with the three months ended June 30, 2018. All significant intercompany transactions, balances, and profits (losses) have been eliminated in consolidation. As a result of the Companys election to withdraw from being regulated as a BDC
under the 1940 Act, effective April 2, 2018, Medallion Bank and various other Company subsidiaries were not consolidated with the Company prior to the three months ended June 30, 2018. See Note 6 for the presentation of financial
information for Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries for such prior periods.  The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company consolidates all entities it controls through a majority voting interest, a controlling interest through other contractual rights, or as being identified as the primary beneficiary of VIEs. The primary
beneficiary is the party who has both (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (2) an obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive benefits
from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. For consolidated entities that are less than wholly owned, the third-partys holding is recorded as non-controlling interest. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
balances are generally held in accounts at large national or regional banking organizations in amounts that exceed the federally insured limits. 
  





Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
The Company follows FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (FASB ASC 820), which defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as an exit price (i.e. a price that would be received to sell, as opposed to acquire, an asset or
transfer a liability), and emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent external sources and the
reporting entitys own assumptions. Further, it specifies that fair value measurement should consider adjustment for risk, such as the risk inherent in the valuation technique or its inputs. See also Notes 18 and 19 to the consolidated
financial statements.  Equity Investments 
Equity investments of $9,197,000 at December 31, 2018, comprised mainly of nonmarketable stock and stock warrants, are recorded at cost
and are evaluated for impairment periodically. Prior to April 2, 2018, equity investments were recorded at fair value, represented as cost, plus or minus unrealized appreciation or depreciation. The fair value of investments that had no ready
market were determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, based upon the financial condition and operating performance of the underlying investee companies as well as general market trends for businesses in the same industry. Included in the
equity investments were non-marketable securities of $9,521,000 at December 31, 2017. 
Investment Securities (Bank Holding Company Accounting) 
The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 320, InvestmentsDebt and Equity Securities (ASC 320), which requires that all applicable investments
in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, and debt securities be classified as trading securities, available-for-sale securities, or held-to-maturity securities. Investment securities are purchased from time to time in the open market at prices that are greater or lesser than the par
value of the investment. The resulting premium or discount is deferred and recognized on a level yield basis as an adjustment to the yield of the related investment. The net premium on investment securities totaled $154,000, and $80,000 was
amortized to interest income for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. Medallion Bank, a previously unconsolidated subsidiary under Investment Company Accounting for the period, had net premium on investment securities of $265,000 as of
December 31, 2017, and $81,000 and $82,000 was amortized to interest income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Refer to Note 3 for more details. ASC 320 further requires that held-to-maturity securities be reported at amortized cost and available-for-sale securities be reported at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings at the date of the financial statements, and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders equity, net of the effect of income
taxes, until they are sold. At the time of sale, any gains or losses, calculated by the specific identification method, will be recognized as a component of operating results and any amounts previously included in shareholders equity, which
were recorded net of the income tax effect, will be reversed.  Other Investment Valuation (Investment Company Accounting)
Prior to April 2, 2018, under the 1940 Act, the Companys investment in Medallion Bank, as a wholly owned portfolio
investment, was subject to quarterly assessments of fair value. The Company conducted a thorough valuation analysis, and also received an opinion regarding the valuation from an independent third party to assist the Board of Directors in its
determination of the fair value of Medallion Bank on at least an annual basis. The Companys analysis included factors such as various regulatory restrictions that were established at Medallion Banks inception, by the FDIC and State of
Utah, and also by additional regulatory restrictions, such as the prior moratorium imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act on the acquisition of control of an industrial bank by a commercial firm (a company whose gross revenues are primarily
derived from non-financial activities) which 
  






expired in July 2013 and the lack of any new charter issuances since the moratoriums expiration. Because of these restrictions and other factors, the Companys Board of Directors had
previously determined that Medallion Bank had little value beyond its recorded book value. As a result of this valuation process, the Company had previously used Medallion Banks actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in
fair value, and recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. In the 2015 second quarter, the Company first became aware of external interest in Medallion Bank and its portfolio assets at values in
excess of their book value. Expression of interest in Medallion Bank from both investment bankers and interested parties has continued. The Company incorporated these new factors in the Medallion Banks fair value analysis and the Board of
Directors determined that Medallion Bank had a fair value in excess of book value. In addition, in the 2016 third quarter there was a court ruling involving a marketplace lender that the Company believes heightened the interest of marketplace
lenders to acquire or merge with Utah industrial banks. The Company also engaged a valuation specialist to assist the Board of Directors in their determination of Medallion Banks fair value, and this appreciation of $15,500,000 was thereby
recorded in 2015, and additional appreciation of $128,918,000 was recorded in 2016, $7,849,000 was recorded in 2017, and $39,826,000 was recorded in the 2018 first quarter. Refer to Note 6 for additional details. 
At December 31, 2017, there were non-marketable securities of $302,147,000 related to portfolio
investments in controlled subsidiaries that were not consolidated with the Company. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations, the Board of Directors estimates of the values of the investments may differ significantly from the values
that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.  Loans 
The Companys loans are currently reported at the principal amount outstanding, inclusive of deferred loan acquisition costs, which
primarily includes deferred fees paid to loan originators, and which is amortized to interest income over the life of the loan. Effective April 2, 2018, the existing loan balances were adjusted to fair value in connection with the change in
reporting, and balances, net of reserves and fees, became the opening balances.  Loan origination fees and certain direct origination
costs are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the yield of the related loans. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, net loan origination costs were $14,416,000 and $90,000 ($11,183,000 when combined with Medallion Bank). The
2018 amount reflects the amount of origination costs that were netted into the loan balances at April 2, 2018. Net amortization (accretion) to income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $3,128,000 ($3,993,000 when
combined with Medallion Bank), $68,000 ($3,581,000 when combined with Medallion Bank), and ($49,000) ($3,440,000 when combined with Medallion Bank). 
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Taxicab medallion and commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status, and all uncollected
accrued interest is reversed, when there is doubt as to the collectability of interest or principal, or if loans are 90 days or more past due, unless management has determined that they are both well-secured and in the process of collection.
Interest income on nonaccrual loans is generally recognized when cash is received, unless a determination has been made to apply all cash receipts to principal. The consumer portfolio has different characteristics, typified by a larger number of
lower dollar loans that have similar characteristics. A loan is considered to be impaired, or nonperforming, when based on current information and events, it is likely the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Management considers loans that are in bankruptcy status, but have not been charged-off, to be impaired. These loans are placed on nonaccrual, when
they become 90 days past due, or earlier if they enter bankruptcy, and are charged off in their entirety when deemed uncollectible, or when they become 120 days past due, whichever occurs first, at which time appropriate collection and recovery
efforts against both the borrower and the underlying collateral are initiated. For the recreational consumer loan portfolio, the process to repossess the collateral is started at 60 days past due. If the collateral is not located and the account

  






reaches 120 days delinquent, the account is charged off. If the collateral is repossessed, a loss is recorded to write the collateral down to its fair value less selling costs, and the collateral
is sent to auction. When the collateral is sold, the net auction proceeds are applied to the account, and any remaining balance is written off. Proceeds collected on charged-off accounts are recorded as a
recovery. Total loans more than 90 days past due were $20,154,000 at December 31, 2018, or 2.03% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $60,450,000, or 18.9% at December 31, 2017. 
Loan collateral in process of foreclosure primarily includes taxicab medallion loans that have reached 120 days past due and have been charged
down to their net realizable value, in addition to consumer repossessed collateral in the process of being sold. The taxicab medallion loan component reflects that the collection activities on the loans have transitioned from working with the
borrower to the liquidation of the collateral securing the loans.  The Company had $40,500,000 and $183,529,000 of net loans pledged as
collateral under borrowing arrangements at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  The Company accounts for its sales of loans
in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing (FASB ASC 860), which provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. In
accordance with FASB ASC 860, the Company had elected the fair value measurement method for its servicing assets and liabilities. The principal portion of loans serviced for others by the Company and its affiliates was $140,180,000 at
December 31, 2018 and $338,867,000 at December 31, 2017, which included $311,988,000 of loans serviced for Medallion Bank. The Company has evaluated the servicing aspect of its business in accordance with FASB ASC 860, which relates to
servicing assets held by MFC (related to the remaining assets in Trust III) and Medallion Bank, and determined that no material servicing asset or liability existed as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company assigned its servicing rights of
the Medallion Bank portfolio to MSC. The costs of servicing were allocated to MSC by the Company, and the servicing fee income was billed to and collected from Medallion Bank by MSC. 
Allowance for Loan Losses (Bank Holding Company Accounting) 
The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon managements periodic review of the
collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic
conditions, and excess concentration risks. In analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company uses historical delinquency and actual loss rates with a one year lookback period for consumer loans. For commercial loans deemed
nonperforming, the historical loss experience and other projections are looked at, and for medallion loans, nonperforming loans are valued at the median sales price over the most recent quarter, and performing medallion loans are reserved utilizing
historical loss ratios over a three year lookback period. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. As a result, reserves of $5,708,000 were
recorded by the Company as a general reserve on medallion loans as an additional buffer against future losses, not including the Bank general reserve of $17,351,000 which was netted against loan balances at consolidation on April 2, 2018.
Credit losses are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added back to the allowance.  Unrealized Appreciation
(Depreciation) and Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments (Investment Company Accounting)  Prior to April 2, 2018, under
Investment Company Accounting, the Companys loans, net of participations and any unearned discount, were considered investment securities under the 1940 Act and recorded at fair value. As part of the fair value methodology, loans were valued
at cost adjusted for any unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Since no ready market existed for these loans, the fair value was determined in good faith by the 
  






Board of Directors. In determining the fair value, the Board of Directors considered factors such as the financial condition of the borrower, the adequacy of the collateral, individual credit
risks, cash flows of the borrower, market conditions for loans (e.g. values used by other lenders and any active bid/ask market), historical loss experience, and the relationships between current and projected market rates and portfolio rates of
interest and maturities. Investments other than securities, which represent collateral received from defaulted borrowers, were valued similarly. 
Under Investment Company Accounting, the Company recognized unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments as the amount by which the
fair value estimated by the Company is greater (less) than the cost basis of the investment portfolio. Realized gains or losses on investments are generated through sales of investments, foreclosure on specific collateral, and writeoffs of loans or
assets acquired in satisfaction of loans, net of recoveries. Unrealized appreciation on investments was $139,700,000 as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 5 for additional details. 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
The Companys goodwill and intangible assets arose as a result of the excess of fair value over book value for several of the
Companys previously unconsolidated portfolio investment companies as of April 2, 2018. This fair value was brought forward under the Companys new reporting, and was subject to a purchase price accounting allocation process conducted
by an independent third party expert to arrive at the current categories and amounts. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful life of approximately
20 years. See below for detailed information on the fair value allocation as of April 2, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had goodwill of $150,803,000, which all related to the Bank, and intangible assets of $53,982,000, and
recognized $1,083,000 of amortization expense on the intangible assets for the year then ended (at a rate of $361,000 per quarter for three quarters). The Company engaged an expert to assess the goodwill and intangibles for impairment, who concluded
there was no impairment on Medallion Bank and impairment on the RPAC intangible asset was $5,615,000, which was recorded in the 2018 fourth quarter. 
The table below shows the initial fair value detail inclusive of the goodwill and intangible assets related to the Bank as of April 2,
2018.   
 


  





The table below shows the initial fair value detail inclusive of the intangible assets
related to RPAC as of April 2, 2018.   
 


The table below shows the details of the intangible assets as of December 31, 2018. 
 
Fixed Assets 
Fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives of 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated economic useful life of the improvement. Depreciation and amortization expense was $422,000,
$94,000 ($232,000 had Medallion Bank been consolidated), and $110,000 ($225,000 had Medallion Bank been consolidated) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. 
Deferred Costs  Deferred
financing costs, included in other assets, represents costs associated with obtaining the Companys borrowing facilities, and is amortized on a straight line basis over the lives of the related financing agreements. Amortization expense was
$1,864,000, $925,000 ($2,255,000 had Medallion Bank been consolidated), and $722,000 ($2,091,000 had Medallion Bank been consolidated) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 
  






2016, recorded as interest expense. In addition, the Company capitalizes certain costs for transactions in the process of completion (other than business combinations), including those for
potential investments, and the sourcing of other financing alternatives. Upon completion or termination of the transaction, any accumulated amounts will be amortized against income over an appropriate period, or written off. The amounts on the
Companys balance sheet for all of these purposes were $4,461,000 and $3,070,000 ($5,011,000 had Medallion Bank been consolidated) at December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
Income Taxes  Income
taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the impact of temporary differences between the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities and their tax basis and are stated at tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and any tax credit
carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided against a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to
determine whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. Items considered in determining our valuation allowance include expectations of future earnings of the appropriate tax character, recent historical financial results, tax
planning strategies, the length of statutory carryforward periods and the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences. Under ASC 740, forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative
evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company recognizes tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. The Company records
income tax related interest and penalties, if applicable, within current income tax expense. Sponsorship and Race Winnings 
The Company accounts for the sponsorship and race winnings revenue under FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Sponsorship
revenue is recognized based upon the contract terms and only over the course of the whole season, will revenue be recognized evenly throughout the ten months. Race winnings revenue is recognized after each race during the season based upon terms
provided by NASCAR and the placement of the driver. 
  





Earnings (Loss) Per Share (EPS) 
Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss)/net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if option contracts to issue common stock were exercised, or if
restricted stock vests, and has been computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Companys stock options and restricted stock. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate diluted EPS, which is
a method of recognizing the use of proceeds that could be obtained upon exercise of options and warrants, including unvested compensation expense related to the shares, in computing diluted EPS. It assumes that any proceeds would be used to purchase
common stock at the average market price during the period. The table below shows the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.   
Potentially dilutive common shares excluded from the above calculations aggregated 100,000, 366,245, and
346,232 shares as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.  Stock Compensation 
The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 718 (ASC 718), Compensation  Stock Compensation, for its equity incentive, stock option, and
restricted stock plans, and accordingly, the Company recognizes the expense of these grants as required. Stock-based employee compensation costs pertaining to stock options is reflected in net increase in net income/net assets resulting from
operations for any new grants using the fair values established by usage of the Black-Scholes option pricing model, expensed over the vesting period of the underlying option. Stock-based employee compensation costs pertaining to restricted stock are
reflected in net income/net increase net assets resulting from operations for any new grants using the grant date fair value of the shares granted, expensed over the vesting period of the underlying stock. 
During 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company issued 101,010, 327,251, and 48,527 restricted shares of stock-based compensation awards, and issued
39,000, 29,666, and 12,000 shares of other stock-based compensation awards, and recognized $576,000, $785,000, and $568,000, or $0.02, $0.03, and $0.02 per diluted common share for each respective year, of
non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the grants. As of December 31, 2018, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and restricted stock was
$244,000, which is expected to be recognized over the next 10 quarters (see Note 9).  Regulatory Capital 
Medallion Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial
Institutions. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain 
  






mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Banks financial statements. Under capital adequacy
guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Banks assets, liabilities, and
certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Banks capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the bank
regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.  FDIC-insured banks, including Medallion Bank, are subject to certain
federal laws, which impose various legal limitations on the extent to which banks may finance or otherwise supply funds to certain of their affiliates. In particular, Medallion Bank is subject to certain restrictions on any extensions of credit to,
or other covered transactions, such as certain purchases of assets, with the Company or its affiliates.  Quantitative measures established
by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios as defined in the regulations (set forth in the table below). Additionally, as conditions of granting the Banks application for federal deposit
insurance, the FDIC ordered that the Tier 1 leverage capital to total assets ratio, as defined, be not less than 15%, which would preclude their ability to pay dividends to the Company, and that an adequate allowance for loan losses be maintained.
As of December 31, 2018, the Banks Tier 1 leverage ratio was 15.85%. The Banks actual capital amounts and ratios, and the regulatory minimum ratios are presented in the following table. 
 
 



In addition, the Bank is subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. The
implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increased by 0.625% each subsequent January 1 until January 1, 2019. Including the buffer, commencing January 1, 2019, the Bank is
required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios: a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 8.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of greater than 10.5%. 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure
Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value. The objective of this update is to modify the disclosure requirements as it relates to the fair value of assets and liabilities. The amendments in this update are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe this update will have a material impact on its financial condition. 
  





In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04
IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The objective of this update is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The
amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe this update will have a material impact on its financial condition. 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses
(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The main objective of this new standard is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial assets and
other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The aftermath of the global economic crisis and the delayed recognition of credit losses associated with loans (and other financial instruments) was identified as
a weakness in the application of existing accounting standards. Specifically, because the existing incurred loss model delays recognition until it is probable a credit loss was incurred, the FASB explored alternatives that would use more
forward-looking information. Under the FASBs new standard, the concepts used by entities to account for credit losses on financial instruments will fundamentally change. The existing probable and incurred loss
recognition threshold is removed. Loss estimates are based upon lifetime expected credit losses. The use of past and current events must now be supplemented with reasonable and supportable expectations about the future to
determine the amount of credit loss. The collective changes to the recognition and measurement accounting standards for financial instruments and their anticipated impact on the allowance for credit losses modeling have been universally referred to
as the CECL (current expected credit loss) model. ASU 2016-13 applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 for public entities and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 for all other entities, with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing the impact the update will have on its financial statements, and expects the update to have a significant impact on
how the Company will account for estimated credit losses on its loans.  In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for leases classified as
operating under GAAP. ASU 2016-02 applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 for public entities. The Company has assessed the impact the
update will have on its financial condition and determined that effective January 1, 2019, a right-of-use asset and lease liability each of $13,997,000 would be recorded, and accrued/amortized over the remaining lease life terms. See Note 12
for additional information.  Reclassifications 
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to conform with the current year presentation. These reclassifications have no
effect on the previously reported results of operations.  (3) INVESTMENT SECURITIES (Bank Holding Company Accounting) 
Fixed maturity securities available for sale at December 31, 2018 consisted of the following: 
 

  





The amortized cost and estimated market value of investment securities as of
December 31, 2018 by contractual maturity are shown below. Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 
 
Information pertaining to securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2018, aggregated by
investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position follows.   
Unrealized losses on securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers bonds are of
high credit quality, and the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach the maturity date. 
As of December 31, 2017, under Investment Company Accounting, investment securities made up 0% of the net investments. 
(4) LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (Bank Holding Company Accounting)

The following table presents total nonaccrual loans and foregone interest, substantially all
of which is in the medallion portfolio. The decline reflects the charge-offs of certain loans and their movement to loan collateral in process of foreclosure. The fluctuation in nonaccrual interest foregone is due to past due loans and market
conditions.   
 

The following
presents our performance status of loans as of December 31, 2018 under Bank Holding Company Accounting.   
For those loans aged 31-90 days, there is a possibility that their
delinquency status will continue to deteriorate and they will subsequently be placed on nonaccrual status and be reserved for, and as such, deemed nonperforming.

(7) FUNDS BORROWED 
The outstanding balances of funds borrowed were as follows:   
 


  





(A) DEPOSITS 
Deposits are raised through the use of investment brokerage firms who package deposits qualifying for FDIC insurance into pools that are sold
to the Bank. The rates paid on the deposits are highly competitive with market rates paid by other financial institutions. Additionally, a brokerage fee is paid, depending on the maturity of the deposits, which averages less than 0.15%. Interest on
the deposits is accrued daily and paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or at maturity. All time deposits are in denominations of less than $250,000 and have been originated through certificates of deposit broker relationships. The table presents
time deposits of $100,000 or more by their maturity:   
(B) DZ LOAN 
In December 2008, Trust III entered into the DZ loan agreement with DZ Bank, to provide up to $200,000,000 of financing through a commercial
paper conduit to acquire medallion loans from MFC (DZ loan), which was extended in December 2013 until December 2016 through an amended and restated credit agreement, which has been further extended several times and currently terminates in
September 2019. The line was reduced to $150,000,000, and was further reduced in stages to $125,000,000 on July 1, 2016, remained as an amortizing facility and was restructured during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Borrowings under Trust IIIs DZ loan are collateralized by Trust IIIs assets. MFC is the servicer of the loans owned by Trust III.
In addition, if certain financial tests are not met, MFC can be replaced as the servicer. See Note 23 for more information about Trust III and the DZ loan. 
(C) SBA DEBENTURES AND BORROWINGS 
Over the years, the SBA has approved commitments for MCI and FSVC, typically for a four and half year term and a 1% fee, which was paid. During
2017, the SBA restructured FSVCs debentures with SBA totaling $33,485,000 in principal into a new loan by the SBA to FSVC in the principal amount of $34,024,756 (the SBA Loan). In connection with the SBA Loan, FSVC executed a Note (the SBA
Note), with an effective date of March 1, 2017, in favor of SBA, in the principal amount of $34,024,756. The SBA Loan bears interest at a rate of 3.25% per annum, required a minimum of $5,000,000 of principal and interest to be paid on or
before February 1, 2018 (which was paid) and a minimum of $10,000,000 of principal and interest to be paid on or before March 15, 2019, and all remaining unpaid principal and interest on or before February 1, 2020, the final maturity
date. The SBA Loan agreement contains covenants and events of defaults, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties and covenants defaults. As of December 31, 2018, $172,485,000 of commitments had
been fully utilized, there were $3,000,000 of commitments available, and $80,099,000 was outstanding, including $29,099,000 under the SBA Note. 
(D) NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS 
The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into note agreements with a variety of local and regional banking institutions over the years.
The notes are typically secured by various assets of the underlying borrower. 
  





The table below summarizes the key attributes of the Companys various borrowing
arrangements with these lenders as of December 31, 2018.   
 




In November 2018, MFC entered into a note to the benefit of DZ Bank for $1,400,000 at a 4.00% interest rate due December 2023, as part of the
restructuring of the DZ loan. See Note 23 for more information.  (E) RETAIL NOTES 
In April 2016, the Company issued a total of $33,625,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.00% unsecured notes due 2021, with interest payable
quarterly in arrears. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $31,786,000 to make loans and other investments in portfolio companies and for general corporate purposes, including repaying borrowings under its DZ loan in
the ordinary course of business.  (F) PREFERRED SECURITIES 
In June 2007, the Company issued and sold $36,083,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured junior subordinated notes to Fin Trust which, in
turn, sold $35,000,000 of preferred securities to Merrill Lynch International and issued 1,083 shares of common stock to the Company. The notes bear a variable rate of interest of 90 day LIBOR (2.81% at December 31, 2018) plus 2.13%. The notes
mature in September 2037 and are prepayable at par. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The terms of the preferred securities and the notes are substantially identical. In December 2007, $2,000,000 of the preferred securities were repurchased
from a third party investor. At December 31, 2018, $33,000,000 was outstanding on the preferred securities.  (G) OTHER
BORROWINGS  In November and December 2017, RPAC amended the terms of various promissory notes with affiliate Richard Petty (refer
to Note 13 for more details). At December 31, 2017, the total outstanding on these notes was 
  






$7,007,894 at a 2.00% annual interest rate compounded monthly and due March 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2018, $7,149,000 was outstanding on these notes. Additionally, RPAC has a short
term promissory note to Travis Burt, an unrelated party, for $500,000 due on December 31, 2019.  (H) COVENANT COMPLIANCE
Certain of our debt agreements contain restrictions that require the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain certain financial
ratios, including debt to equity and minimum net worth, which in the event of noncompliance could preclude their ability to pay dividends to the Company. 
(8) INCOME TAXES  The Company is subject
to federal and applicable state corporate income taxes on its taxable ordinary income and capital gains. As a corporation taxed under Subchapter C, the Company is able, and intends, to file a consolidated federal income tax return with corporate
subsidiaries in which it holds 80 percent or more of the outstanding equity interest measured by both vote and fair value.  The
following table sets forth the significant components of our deferred and other tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.   
 

  





The components of our tax benefit (provision) for the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017, and 2016 were as follows.   
The following table presents a reconciliation of statutory federal income tax benefit (provision) to
consolidated actual income tax (benefit) expense reported for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.   
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which,
starting in 2018, reduced the Companys corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, but eliminated or increased certain permanent differences. 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible pursuant to ASC 740. The Company considers
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Companys evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets must consider both positive and negative
evidence. The weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Based upon these considerations, the Company determined the valuation allowance deemed necessary as
of December 31, 2018.  The Company has filed tax returns in many states. Federal, New York State, New York City, and Utah tax filings
of the Company for the tax years 2015 through the present are the more significant filings that are open for examination. Currently the Company and the Bank are undergoing various state exams covering the years 2009 to 2011 and 2013 to 2017. 
(9) STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK 
The Company has a stock option plan (2006 Stock Option Plan) available to grant both incentive and nonqualified stock options to employees. The
2006 Stock Option Plan, which was approved by the Board of 
  






Directors on February 15, 2006 and shareholders on June 16, 2006, provided for the issuance of a maximum of 800,000 shares of common stock of the Company. No additional shares are
available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Option Plan. The 2006 Stock Option Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The option price per share may not be less than the current market value of the
Companys common stock on the date the option is granted. The term and vesting periods of the options are determined by the Compensation Committee, provided that the maximum term of an option may not exceed a period of ten years. 
The Companys Board of Directors approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (2018 Plan), which was approved by the Companys
shareholders on June 15, 2018. The terms of 2018 Plan provide for grants of a variety of different type of stock awards to the Companys employees, including options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, etc. A total of 1,500,253
shares of the Companys common stock are issuable under the 2018 Plan, and 1,458,407 remained issuable as of December 31, 2018. Awards under the 2018 Plan are subject to certain limitations as set forth in the 2018 Plan, which will
terminate when all shares of common stock authorized for delivery have been delivered and the forfeiture restrictions on all awards have lapsed, or by action of the Board of Directors pursuant to the 2018 Plan, whichever first occurs. 
The Companys Board of Directors approved the 2015 Employee Restricted Stock Plan (2015 Restricted Stock Plan) on February 13, 2015,
which was approved by the Companys shareholders on June 5, 2015. The 2015 Restricted Stock Plan became effective upon the Companys receipt of exemptive relief from the SEC on March 1, 2016. The terms of 2015 Restricted Stock
Plan provide for grants of restricted stock awards to the Companys employees. A grant of restricted stock is a grant of shares of the Companys common stock which, at the time of issuance, is subject to certain forfeiture provisions, and
thus is restricted as to transferability until such forfeiture restrictions have lapsed. A total of 700,000 shares of the Companys common stock were issuable under the 2015 Restricted Stock Plan, and 241,919 remained issuable as of
June 15, 2018. Effective June 15, 2018, the 2018 Plan was approved, and these remaining shares were rolled into the 2018 Plan. Awards under the 2015 Restricted Stock Plan are subject to certain limitations as set forth in the 2015
Restricted Stock Plan. The 2015 Restricted Stock Plan will terminate when all shares of common stock authorized for delivery under the 2015 Restricted Stock Plan have been delivered and the forfeiture restrictions on all awards have lapsed, or by
action of the Board of Directors pursuant to the 2015 Restricted Stock Plan, whichever first occurs.  The Companys Board of
Directors approved the 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (2015 Director Plan) on March 12, 2015, which was approved by the Companys shareholders on June 5, 2015, and on which
exemptive relief to implement the 2015 Director Plan was received from the SEC on February 29, 2016. A total of 300,000 shares of the Companys common stock were issuable under the 2015 Director Plan, and 258,334 remained issuable as of
June 15, 2018. Effective June 15, 2018, the 2018 Plan was approved, and these remaining shares were rolled into the 2018 Plan. Under the 2015 Director Plan, unless otherwise determined by a committee of the Board of Directors comprised of
directors who are not eligible for grants under the 2015 Director Plan, the Company will grant options to purchase 12,000 shares of the Companys common stock to a non-employee director upon election to
the Board of Directors, with an adjustment for directors who are elected to serve less than a full term. The option price per share may not be less than the current market value of the Companys common stock on the date the option is granted.
Options granted under the 2015 Director Plan are exercisable annually, as defined in the 2015 Director Plan. The term of the options may not exceed ten years. 
The Companys Board of Directors approved the First Amended and Restated 2006 Director Plan (the Amended Director Plan) on April 16,
2009, which was approved by the Companys shareholders on June 5, 2009, and on which exemptive relief to implement the Amended Director Plan was received from the SEC on July 17, 2012. A total of 200,000 shares of the Companys
common stock were issuable under the Amended Director Plan. No additional shares are available for issuance under the Amended Director Plan. Under the Amended Director Plan, unless otherwise determined by a committee of the Board of Directors
comprised of directors who are not eligible for grants under the Amended Director Plan, the Company will grant options to purchase 9,000 shares of the Companys common stock to an Eligible Director upon election to the Board of Directors, with
an adjustment for directors who are elected to serve less than a full term. The option price per 
  






share may not be less than the current market value of the Companys common stock on the date the option is granted. Options granted under the Amended Director Plan are exercisable annually,
as defined in the Amended Director Plan. The term of the options may not exceed ten years.  Additional shares are only available for
future issuance under the 2018 Plan. At December 31, 2018, 144,666 options on the Companys common stock were outstanding under the Companys plans, of which 81,889 options were exercisable, and there were 190,915 unvested shares of
the Companys common stock outstanding under the Companys restricted stock plans.  The fair value of each restricted stock
grant is determined on the date of grant by the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the grant date. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
weighted average fair value of options granted was $1.06, $0.28, and $0.53 per share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. The following assumption categories are used to determine the value of any option grants.

(10) QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED) 
The following table presents the Companys quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
 
 
(11) SEGMENT REPORTING (Bank Holding Company
Accounting)  Under Bank Holding Company Accounting, the Company has six business segments, which include four lending and two non-operating segments, which are reflective of how Company management makes decisions about its business and operations. 
Prior to April 2, 2018, the Company had one business segment, its lending and investing operations. This segment originated and serviced
medallion, secured commercial and consumer loans, and invested in both marketable and nonmarketable securities.  The four lending segments
reflect the main types of lending performed at the Company, which are recreation, home improvement, commercial, and medallion. The recreation and home improvement lending segments are conducted by the Bank in all fifty states, with the highest
concentrations in Texas, California, and Florida, at 18%, 11%, and 10% of loans outstanding and with no other states over 10% as of December 31, 2018. The recreation lending segment is a consumer finance business that works with third-party
dealers and financial 
  






service providers for the purpose of financing RVs, boats, and other consumer recreational equipment. The home improvement lending segment works with contractors and financial service providers
to finance residential home improvements concentrated in swimming pools, solar panels, roofs, and windows, at 31%, 16%, 15%, and 11% of total loans outstanding, respectively, and with no other product lines over 10% as of December 31, 2018. The
commercial lending segment focuses on enterprise wide industries, including manufacturing, retail trade, information, recreation and various other industries, in which 42% of these loans are made in the Midwest. The medallion lending segment arose
in connection with the financing of the taxicab medallions, taxicabs, and related assets, of which 87% were in New York City as of December 31, 2018. 
In addition, our non-operating segments include RPAC which is a race car team and our corporate and
other segment which includes items not allocated to our operating segments such as investment securities, equity investments, intercompany eliminations, and other corporate elements. 
The following table presents segment data at December 31, 2018 and for the nine months then ended. 
 
(12) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
(A) EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 
The Company has employment agreements with certain key officers for either a two- or five-year term.
Annually, the contracts with a five-year term will renew for new five-year terms unless prior to the end of the 
  






first year, either the Company or the executive provides notice to the other party of its intention not to extend the employment period beyond the current five-year term. Annually, the contracts
with a two-year term will renew for new two-year terms unless prior to the term either the Company or the executive provides notice to the other party of its intention
not to extend the employment period beyond the current one-year term. In the event of a change in control, as defined, during the employment period, the agreements provide for severance compensation to the
executive in an amount equal to the balance of the salary, bonus, and value of fringe benefits which the executive would be entitled to receive for the remainder of the employment period. 
Employment agreements expire at various dates through 2023. At December 31, 2018, minimum payments under employment agreements were as
follows:   
(B) OTHER COMMITTMENTS 
The Company had no commitments outstanding at December 31, 2018. Generally, commitments are on the same terms as loans to or investments
in existing borrowers or investees, and generally have fixed expiration dates. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
Commitments for leased premises expire at various dates through April 30, 2027. At December 31, 2018, minimum rental commitments for
non-cancelable leases were as follows:   
Occupancy expense was $2,287,000, $1,069,000, and $966,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017,
and 2016.  (C) LITIGATION 
The Company and its subsidiaries become defendants to various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business. In the opinion of
management, based on the advice of legal counsel, other than as set forth in the following paragraph there is no proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of management threatened, which in the event of an adverse decision could result in a material
adverse impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. 
  





On December 20, 2017, a stockholder derivative action was filed in the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, County of New York (Shields v. Murstein, et al.). The complaint named the Company as a nominal defendant and purports to assert claims derivatively on behalf of the Company against certain of the Companys
current directors, one of the Companys former directors, and a former independent contractor for one of the Companys subsidiaries. The complaint alleged that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties with respect to
certain alleged misconduct by the former independent contractor involving postings about the Company under an alleged pseudonym. On January 25, 2018, the Company and the director defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action. On
June 27, 2018, a hearing was held on the motion. On November 26, 2018, the Court entered a decision granting the motion. On December 17, 2018, the Court entered an order dismissing the plaintiffs complaint with prejudice. The
time for the plaintiff to appeal the Courts order has elapsed.  (D) REGULATORY 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to inquiries from certain regulators. During 2014, FSVC was
examined by the SBA. The foregoing regulatory examination was resolved in January 2017 as a result of Freshstarts transfer to liquidation status and the restructure of the Freshstart loan described in Note 7. 
(13) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  Certain
directors, officers, and shareholders of the Company are also directors and officers of its main consolidated subsidiaries, MFC, MCI, FSVC, and Medallion Bank, as well as other subsidiaries. Officer salaries are set by the Board of Directors of the
Company.  Jeffrey Rudnick, the son of one of the Companys directors, is an officer of LAX Group, LLC (LAX), one of the
Companys equity investments. Mr. Rudnick receives a salary from LAX of $171,000 per year, and certain equity from LAX consisting of 10% ownership in LAX Class B stock, vesting at 3.34% per year; 5% of any new equity raised from
outside investors at a valuation of $1,500,000 or higher; and 10% of LAXs profits as a year-end bonus. In addition, Mr. Rudnick provides consulting services to the Company directly for a monthly
retainer of $4,200.  The Companys consolidated subsidiary RPAC, has an agreement with minority shareholder Richard Petty, in which
they make an annual payment of $700,000 per year for services provided to the entity. In addition, RPAC has a note payable to a trust controlled by Mr. Petty of $7,149,000 that earns interest at an annual rate of 2% as of December 31,
2018.  The Company and MSC serviced $311,988,000 and $325,751,000 of loans for Medallion Bank at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Under
Investment Company Accounting, included in net investment income were amounts as described in the table below that were received from Medallion Bank for services rendered in originating and servicing loans, and also for reimbursement of certain
expenses incurred on their behalf.  The Company assigned its servicing rights to the Medallion Bank portfolio to MSC, a wholly-owned
entity that had been unconsolidated under Investment Company Accounting. The costs of servicing are allocated to MSC by the Company, and the servicing fee income is billed and collected from Medallion Bank by MSC. As a result, $5,272,000 and
$5,421,000 of servicing fee income was earned by MSC in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
  





The following table summarizes the net revenues received from Medallion Bank not eliminated
under Investment Company Accounting.   
The Company had a loan to Medallion Fine Art, Inc., a wholly-owned entity that had been unconsolidated under
Investment Company Accounting, in the amount of $999,000 as of December 31, 2017, which was repaid in full during the 2018 first quarter. The loan bore interest at a rate of 12%, all of which was paid in kind. During 2017, the Company
advanced $0, and was repaid $2,365,000 with respect to this loan. Additionally, the Company recognized $10,000 of interest income not eliminated for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $165,000 and $596,000 of interest income in 2017 and
2016.  The Company and MCI have loans to RPAC, an affiliate of Medallion Motorsports LLC, which totaled $16,472,000 as of
December 31, 2017 and under Investment Company Accounting had not been eliminated, and which were placed on nonaccrual during 2017. These loans have been eliminated in consolidation for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The
loans bear interest at 2%, inclusive of cash and paid in kind interest. The Company and MCI recognized $0 of interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, recognized
$56,000 and $626,000 of interest income with respect to these loans.  (14) STOCKHOLDERS/SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY 
In November 2003, the Company announced a stock repurchase program which authorized the repurchase of up to $10,000,000 of common stock during
the following six months, with an option for the Board of Directors to extend the time frame for completing the purchases, which expired in May 2018. In November 2004, the repurchase program was increased by an additional $10,000,000, which was
further increased to a total of $20,000,000 in July 2014, and which was further increased to a total of $26,000,000 in July 2015. As of December 31, 2018, a total of 2,931,125 shares had been repurchased for $24,587,000. There were no purchases
in 2018 and 2017, and purchases were 361,174 shares for $1,524,000 in 2016.  (15) OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES (Investment Company Accounting) 
The major components of other expenses were as follows.   

  





(16) SELECTED FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER DATA (Investment Company Accounting) 
The following table provides selected financial ratios and other data for the periods indicated. 
 
 




  






(17) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401(k) Investment Plan (the 401(k) Plan) which covers all full-time and part-time employees of the Company who have
attained the age of 21 and have a minimum of one year of service, including the employees of Medallion Bank. Under the 401(k) Plan, an employee may elect to defer not less than 1% and no more than 15% of the total annual compensation that would
otherwise be paid to the employee, provided, however, that employees contributions may not exceed certain maximum amounts determined under the Internal Revenue Code. Employee contributions are invested in various mutual funds according to the
directions of the employee. The Company matches employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan in an amount per employee up to one-third of such employees contribution but in no event greater than 2% of the
portion of such employees annual salary eligible for 401(k) Plan benefits. The Companys 401(k) plan expense, including amounts for the employees of Medallion Bank and other consolidated subsidiaries in the prior year periods, was
approximately $182,000, $185,000, and $187,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.  (18) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information about certain financial
instruments, whether assets, liabilities, or off-balance-sheet commitments, if practicable. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument.
Fair value estimates that were derived from broker quotes cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. 
 

 
 
 
 
 

  





 
 


(19) FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 820, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a
fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. 
In accordance with FASB ASC 820, the Company has categorized its assets and liabilities measured at fair value, based on the priority of the
inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (level 3). Our assessment and classification of an investment within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the investment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in which the change occurred. 
As required by FASB ASC 820, when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which
the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For example, a level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (level 1 and 2) and
unobservable (level 3). Therefore gains and losses for such assets and liabilities categorized within the level 3 table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (level 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs
(level 3).  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value, recorded on the consolidated balance sheets, are categorized based on the
inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:  Level 1. Assets and liabilities whose values are based on
unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access (examples include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-traded derivatives, most US Government and agency
securities, and certain other sovereign government obligations).  Level 2. Assets and liabilities whose values are based
on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: 
 

  





 

 

Level 3. Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are
both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect managements own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the assets or liability (examples include certain private
equity investments, and certain residential and commercial mortgage-related assets, including loans, securities, and derivatives).  A
review of fair value hierarchy classification is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets or liabilities. Reclassifications impacting level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy are reported as transfers in/out of the level 3 category as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur. The following paragraphs describe the sensitivity of the various level 3 valuations to the factors that
are relevant in their valuation analysis under both Bank Holding Company Accounting (applicable as of June 30, 2018 and for the quarter then ended) and Investment Company Accounting (applicable to prior periods). 
Bank Holding Company Accounting 
Commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2018, equity investments are recorded at cost and are evaluated for impairment periodically.
The following table presents the Companys fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of December 31, 2018.   
 
Investment Company Accounting 
Medallion loans are primarily collateral-based lending, whereby the collateral value exceeds the amount of the loan, providing sufficient
excess collateral to protect against losses to the Company. As a result, under Investment Company Accounting, the initial valuation assessment was that as long as the loan is current and performing, its fair value approximates the par value of the
loan. To the extent a loan became nonperforming, the collateral value would be adequate to result in a complete recovery. In a case where the collateral value was inadequate, an unrealized loss would be recorded to reflect any shortfall. Collateral
values for medallion loans are typically obtained from transfer prices reported by the regulatory agency in a particular local market (e.g. 
  






New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission). Recently, as transfer price activity and the collateral value of medallion loans has declined, greater weight was placed on the operating cash flows
of the borrowers and the values of their personal guarantees in determining whether or not a valuation adjustment would be necessary. Those portfolios had historically been at very low loan to collateral value ratios, and as a result, historically
were not highly sensitive to changes in collateral values. Over the last few years, as medallion collateral values declined, the impact on the Companys valuation analysis had become more significant, which could have resulted in a
significantly lower fair value measurement.  The mezzanine and other secured commercial portions of the commercial loan portfolio were a
combination of cash flow and collateral based lending. The initial valuation assessment was that as long as the loan is current and performing, its fair value approximates the par value of the loan. If a loan became nonperforming, an evaluation
would be performed which considered and analyzed a variety of factors which may have included the financial condition and operating performance of the borrower, the adequacy of the collateral, individual credit risks, historical loss experience, the
relationships between the then current and projected market rates and portfolio rates of interest and maturities, as well as general market trends for businesses in the same industry. Since each individual nonperforming loan had its own unique
attributes, the factors analyzed, and their relative importance to each valuation analysis, differed between each asset, and may have differed from period to period for a particular asset. The valuation was highly sensitive to changes in the
assumptions used. To the extent that any assumption in the analysis changed significantly from one period to another, that change could have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair market value measurement. For example, if a borrowers
valuation was determined primarily on the cash flow generated from their business, then if that cash flow deteriorated significantly from a prior period valuation, that could have had a material impact on the valuation in the appropriate period.
The investment in Medallion Bank was subject to a thorough valuation analysis as described previously, and on at least an annual basis,
the Company received an opinion regarding the valuation from an independent third party to assist the Board of Directors in its determination of the fair value. The Company determined whether any factors gave rise to a valuation different than
recorded book value, including various regulatory restrictions that were established at Medallion Banks inception, by the FDIC and State of Utah, and also by additional regulatory restrictions, such as the prior moratorium imposed by the
Dodd-Frank Act on the acquisition of control of an industrial bank by a commercial firm (a company whose gross revenues are primarily derived from non-financial activities) which expired in July
2013, and the lack of any new charter issuances since the moratoriums expiration. Because of these restrictions and other factors, the Companys Board of Directors had previously determined that Medallion Bank had little value beyond its
recorded book value. As a result of this valuation process, the Company had previously used Medallion Banks actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value, and recorded the results as a component of unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) on investments. In the 2015 second quarter, the Company first became aware of external interest in Medallion Bank and its portfolio assets at values in excess of their book value. The Company incorporated those factors in
the Medallion Banks fair value analysis and the Board of Directors determined that Medallion Bank had a fair value in excess of book value. Expression of interest in Medallion Bank from both investment bankers and interested parties has
continued through 2016 and 2017. The Company incorporated those new factors in the Medallion Banks fair value analysis and the Board of Directors determined that Medallion Bank had a fair value in excess of book value. In addition, in the 2016
third quarter there was a court ruling involving a marketplace lender that the Company believed heightened the interest of marketplace lenders to acquire or merge with Utah industrial banks. The Company also engaged a valuation specialist to assist
the Board of Directors in their determination of Medallion Banks fair value, and the appreciation of $15,500,000 was thereby recorded in 2015, additional appreciation of $128,918,000 was recorded in 2016, $7,849,000 was recorded in 2017, and
$39,826,000 was recorded in 2018.  Investments in controlled subsidiaries, other than Medallion Bank, equity investments, and investments
other than securities were valued similarly, but also considered available then-current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, the nature and realizable value of any

  






collateral, applicable interest rates and market yields, the portfolio companys ability to make payments, its earnings and cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does
business, and borrower financial analysis, among other factors. As a result of this valuation process, the Company used the actual results of operations of the controlled subsidiaries as the best estimate of changes in fair value, in most cases, and
recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. For the balance of controlled subsidiary investments, equity investments, and investments other than securities positions, the result of the analysis
resulted in changes to the value of the position if there was clear evidence that its value had either decreased or increased in light of the specific facts considered for each investment. The valuation was highly sensitive to changes in the
assumptions used. To the extent that any assumption in the analysis changed significantly from one period to another, that change could have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair market value measurement. For example, if an
investees valuation was determined primarily on the cash flow generated from their business, then if that cash flow deteriorated significantly from a prior period valuation, that could have a material impact on the valuation in the current
period.  The following tables present the Companys fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of December 31, 2017.   
Included in level 3 investments in Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries is primarily the
investment in Medallion Bank, as well as other consolidated subsidiaries such as MSC, and other investments detailed in the consolidated summary schedule of investments following these footnotes. Included in level 3 equity investments are
unregistered shares of common stock in a publicly-held company, as well as certain private equity positions in non-marketable securities. 
The following tables provide a summary of changes in fair value of the Companys level 3 assets and liabilities for the nine months ended

The following table presents the Companys investments other than securities as of December 31, 2017 under Investment Company
Accounting.   
 



(21) SMALL BUSINESS LENDING FUND PROGRAM (SBLF) AND TROUBLED ASSETS RELIEF PROGRAM (TARP) 
On February 27, 2009 and December 22, 2009, Medallion Bank issued, and the U.S. Treasury purchased under the TARP Capital Purchase
Program (the CPP), Medallion Banks fixed rate non-cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, B, C, and D for an aggregate purchase price of $21,498,000 in cash. On July 21, 2011,

  






Medallion Bank issued, and the U.S. Treasury purchased, 26,303 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E (Series E) for
an aggregate purchase price of $26,303,000 under the SBLF. The SBLF is a voluntary program intended to encourage small business lending by providing capital to qualified smaller banks at favorable rates. In connection with the issuance of the Series
E, the Bank exited the CPP by redeeming the Series A, B, C, and D; and received approximately $4,000,000, net of dividends due on the repaid securities. The Bank pays a dividend rate of 9% on the Series E.

(23) VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE) 
During the 2018 third quarter, the Company determined that Trust III was a VIE. Trust III had been consolidated as a subsidiary of MFC
historically, although it should have been consolidated under the variable interest model, since MFC was its primary beneficiary until October 31, 2018. Trust III is a VIE since the key decision-making authority rests in the servicing agreement
(where MFC is the servicer for Trust III) rather than in the voting rights of the equity interests and as a result the decision-making rights are considered a variable interest. This conclusion is supported by a qualitative assessment that Trust III
does not have sufficient equity at risk. Since the inception of Trust III, MFC had also been party to a limited guaranty which was considered a variable interest because, pursuant to the guaranty, MFC absorbed variability as a result of the on-going performance of the loans in Trust III. As of October 31, 2018, the Company determined that MFC was no longer the primary beneficiary of Trust III and accordingly deconsolidated the VIE, leading to a
net gain of $25,325,000 recorded as well as a new promissory note payable by MFC of $1,400,000 issued in settlement of the limited guaranty (see Note 7 for more details). In addition, the Company remains the servicer of the assets of Trust III for a
fee. 
  





The following table shows the assets and liabilities of Trust III as December 31, 2017
when it had been a consolidated VIE.

PART I
 


 
ITEM 1.  Business
 
Spin-Off of Henry Schein Animal Health Business
 
On February 7, 2019 (the “Distribution Date”), we completed the previously announced separation (the “Separation”) and subsequent merger of our animal health business (the “Henry Schein Animal Health Business”) with Direct Vet Marketing, Inc. (d/b/a Vets First Choice, “Vets First Choice”) (the “Merger”).  This was accomplished by a series of transactions among us, Vets First Choice, Covetrus, Inc. (f/k/a HS Spinco, Inc. “Covetrus”), a wholly owned subsidiary of ours prior to the Distribution Date, and HS Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Covetrus (“Merger Sub”).  In connection with the Separation, we contributed, assigned and transferred to Covetrus certain applicable assets, liabilities and capital stock or other ownership interests relating to the Henry Schein Animal Health Business.  On the Distribution Date, we received a tax-free distribution of $1,120.0 million from Covetrus pursuant to certain debt financing incurred by Covetrus.  On the Distribution Date and prior to the Distribution, Covetrus issued shares of Covetrus common stock to certain institutional accredited investors (the “Share Sale Investors”) for $361.1 million (the “Share Sale”).  The proceeds of the Share Sale were paid to Covetrus and distributed to us.  Subsequent to the Share Sale, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of the common stock of Covetrus held by us to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2019 (the “Animal Health Spin-off”).  After the Share Sale and Animal Health Spin-off, Merger Sub consummated the Merger whereby it merged with and into Vets First Choice, with Vets First Choice surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Covetrus.  Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, on a fully diluted basis, (i) approximately 63% of the shares of Covetrus common stock were (a) owned by our stockholders and the Share Sale Investors, and (b) in respect of certain equity awards held by certain employees of the Henry Schein Animal Health Business, and (ii) approximately 37% of the shares of Covetrus common stock were (a) owned by stockholders of Vets First Choice immediately prior to the Merger, and (b) in respect of certain equity awards held by certain employees of Vets First Choice.  After the Separation and the Merger, we no longer beneficially owned any shares of Covetrus common stock and, following the Distribution Date, will not consolidate the financial results of Covetrus for the purpose of our financial reporting.  Following the Separation and the Merger, Covetrus was an independent, publicly traded company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, under the symbol CVET.
 
All financial information within this Form 10-K includes the Henry Schein Animal Health Business as the Separation occurred in 2019.  Effective first quarter 2019, we will report the historical earnings of the Henry Schein Animal Health Business as a discontinued operation.  The Company estimates that on a continuing operations basis, its 2018 revenues were $9.4 billion and its 2018 net income was $430.7 million.
 
General
 
The description of our business throughout this Form 10-K excludes our global animal health business as the filing date of this Form 10-K is subsequent to the effective date of the Separation.
 
We believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental and medical practitioners.  We serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories and physician practices, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.  We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 86 years of experience distributing health care products.
 
We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 18,000 people (of which more than 8,800 are based outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 31 countries, including the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
 
We offer a comprehensive selection of products and services and value-added solutions for operating efficient practices and delivering high quality care.  We operate through a centralized and automated distribution network 







 



 
with a selection of more than 120,000 branded products and Henry Schein private brand products in stock, as well as more than 180,000 additional products available as special order items.  We also offer our customers exclusive, innovative technology solutions, including practice management software and e-commerce solutions, as well as a broad range of financial services.
 
We have established over 3.5 million square feet of space in 30 strategically located distribution centers around the world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs.  Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.
 
We conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.  
 
The health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, medical and, prior to the completion of the Animal Health Spin-off, animal health operating segments.  This segment distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.  Our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  Our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.  
 
Our technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  Our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental, medical and, prior to the completion of the Animal Health Spin-off, animal health practitioners.  Our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners.
 
  
Industry
 
The health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and diverse.  The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.
 
Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.
 
The health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage.  In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices.
 
We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.
 







 


 
In recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.
 
Competition 
 
The distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive.  Many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers.  In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products.  Manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.  
 
In North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers, of dental and medical products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, customer service and value-added products and services.  In the dental market, our primary competitors are the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company.  In addition, we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional and local level.  Our primary competitors in the medical market are McKesson Corporation and Medline Industries, Inc., which are national distributors.  We also compete against a number of regional and local medical distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians.  With regard to our dental practice management software, we compete against numerous companies, including Carestream Health, Inc. and the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc.  The medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the NextGen division of Quality Systems, Inc., eClinicalWorks and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. 
 
We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Pluradent AG & Co., Lifco AB, Planmeca Oy, Billericay Dental Supply Co. Ltd., as well as a large number of dental and medical product distributors and manufacturers in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
 
Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices.  Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We have more than 86 years of experience in distributing products to health care practitioners resulting in strong awareness of the Henry Schein® brand.  Our competitive strengths include:
 



 



 







 




 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 







 




 



 



 
Products
 
The following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our health care distribution and technology reportable segments:  
  



 
Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to continue to expand as a global value-added provider of health care products and services to office-based dental and medical practitioners.  To accomplish this, we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:







 

 



 



 



 



 
Markets Served  
 
Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is increasingly using health care services.  Between 2018 and 2028, the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12%.  Between 2018 and 2038, this age group is expected to grow by approximately 24%.  This compares with expected total U.S. population growth rates of approximately 8% between 2018 and 2028 and approximately 14% between 2018 and 2038.  
 
In the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases.  There is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates.  At the same time, there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage.
 
We support our dental professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency.  
 
In the medical market, there continues to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians’ offices, a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us.  There also is the continuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care settings.  We believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician practitioner.
 
Additionally, we are expanding our dental full-service model and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist.  Through our “Schein Direct” program, we also have the capability to provide door-to-door air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results
 
We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.
 
Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including: 
 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 







 




 



 



 



 
Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate.  If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Operating, Security and Licensure Standards
 
Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Among the United States federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (“FDC Act”), and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.  We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations.
 
The FDC Act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state.  Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as “HCT/P products.”
 
The Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and pre-empts state law.  Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), is being phased in over ten years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.  The law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, and continues to be implemented.  The DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the DSCSA requirements.
 
The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers (“3PLs”), and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities.  The DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs.  The DSCSA requires wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports to the FDA, which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name and address of each facility and contact information.  According to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area.  Current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the FDA issues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA.  
 
We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable DSCSA requirements.
 
The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification (“UDI”) system.  The FDA is phasing in the implementation of the UDI regulations over seven years, generally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices.  Most compliance dates were reached as of September 24, 2018, with a final set of 







 



 
requirements for low risk devices being reached on September 24, 2022, which will complete the phase in.  The UDI regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers (“UDIs”), with a content and format prescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited issuing agency, on the labels and packages of medical devices, and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs.  The UDI regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA, much of which information is publicly available on an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database.  The UDI regulations provide for certain exceptions, alternatives and time extensions.  For example, the UDI regulations include a general exception for Class I devices exempt from the Quality System Regulation (other than record-keeping requirements and complaint files).  Regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers, repackagers, reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified, with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label, and include certain of our businesses.
 
We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable UDI requirements.
 
Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) permitting us to handle controlled substances.  We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling, reporting, record-keeping and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.  We are subject to inspection by the DEA.
 
Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale.  These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment.  In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example, human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue.  We are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products.  The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.  Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers.  Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell, which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm.  Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation.
 
Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions.
 
Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors.
 
Antitrust
 
The U.S. federal government, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive.  Violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties.  Private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages.
 







 


 
Health Care Fraud
 
Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.
 
The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws, and who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.  Penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe.  For example, under the federal False Claims Act, violations may result in treble damages, plus civil penalties of up to $22,363 per claim, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties.  With respect to “anti-kickback laws,” violations of, for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Law may result in civil penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties.  Notably, effective October 24, 2018, a new federal anti-kickback law (the “Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018”) enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation, may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services, regardless of whether the services at issue involved addiction services, and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer.  Furthermore, the United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2016 (the “Health Care Reform Law”) significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, clarifying that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.
 
With respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.
 
We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.
 
Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance.
 
While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 







 


 
Health Care Reform
 
The Health Care Reform Law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage.
 
The Health Care Reform Law requirements include a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales.  However, with respect to the medical device excise tax, a two year moratorium was imposed under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017, and on January 22, 2018 an additional two-year moratorium was imposed under Public Law No. 115-120, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2019.  The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance.  The Health Care Reform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented. 
 
In addition, the President is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law.  Repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate.  Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it, including, without limitation, by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the Health Care Reform Law.  On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law.  Further, in December 2018, a Texas federal court struck down the entire Health Care Reform Law, a ruling which is being appealed, and, if upheld could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry.  The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan.
 
A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program,  imposes  annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.  Effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives must be reported.
 
Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.  We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements, our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us.
 
Another notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), enacted on April 16, 2015, established a new payment framework, called the Quality Payment Program, which modifies certain Medicare payments to “eligible clinicians,” including physicians, dentists and other practitioners.  Under MACRA, certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in Medicare through the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) or Advanced Alternative Payment Models (“APMs”).  MIPS generally consolidated three current programs; the physician quality reporting system, the value-based payment 







 



 
modifier and the Medicare electronic health record (“EHR”) programs into a single program in which Medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality, promoting interoperability, resource use, clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information.  Advanced APMs generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk.    The first MIPS performance year was 2017, and the data collected in the first performance year determines payment adjustments beginning January 1, 2019.  MACRA represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations.  The implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace.  MACRA may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment, leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base.  Although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this.
 
As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes.  We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.
 
Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records
 
The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings.  The 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”), signed into law on December 13, 2016, amended the device definition to exclude certain software, including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria.  In December 2017, the FDA issued draft guidance documents describing its proposed interpretation of the statutory language regarding which types of clinical decision support tools and other software are exempt from regulation as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.
 
In addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.  These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.  For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations (“HIPAA”).  HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities.
 
In addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted a new pan-European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), effective from May 25, 2018, which increased privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in Europe (“Data Subjects”) or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe).  Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues.  Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data.  Among other things, the GDPR requires with respect to data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data.  While we expect we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR requirements, our compliance 







 



 
with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.
 
Various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The initiatives include, among others, programs that incentivize physicians and dentists, through Medicare’s MIPS, to use certified EHR technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements, including regarding quality, promoting interoperability, resource use, clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information.  Qualification for the MIPS incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by CMS and by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (“ONC”) of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”).  These standards have been subject to change.  
 
Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to MIPS and other incentive programs.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy the changing governmental standards. If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, we are exposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act.  For example, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155 million settlement and 5-year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based on allegations that the vendor, by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the False Claims Act.  While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality.  Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers.  Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements.  Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties, and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.
 
Additionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important.  On September 6, 2017, the FDA issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information.  As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.
 







 


 
There may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care.
 
E-Commerce
 
Electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships.  Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition.  The continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.
 
Through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives.  We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business.  We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.
 
International Transactions
 
In addition, United States and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products.  We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the United States.
 
While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business, there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business.  
 
See “ITEM 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of additional burdens, risks and regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Proprietary Rights
 
We hold trademarks relating to the “Henry Schein®” name and logo, as well as certain other trademarks.  We intend to protect our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
 
The risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock.  Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations.  You should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.  The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.
 
The health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating, and we may not be able to compete successfully. 
 
We compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.  Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully.  Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors.  Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market.  Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and the roles of other distributors.  Industry consolidation among health care product distributors, price competition, the unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition.  There has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability.  Additionally, in this competitive market, some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments.  We could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments.  In the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability.
 
Because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.
 
We obtain substantially all of our products from third parties.  Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us.  Therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request.  While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, some key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell.  Additionally, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements.  The failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions.  In the event that any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in our required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis.  There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all.  An extended interruption in the supply of our products, especially any high sales volume product, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock.
 
Our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.
 
Our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers.  If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected.
 







 


 
Our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management.
 
Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman.  We do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees.  Competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.
 
We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.
 
Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including: 
 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 







 




 



 



 



 



 



 
Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate.  If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.
 
Expansion of group purchasing organizations (“GPO”) or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
 
The medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs, demand more favorable pricing terms. Additionally, the formation of provider networks and GPOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship. This may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results. Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to obtain access to lower prices demanded by GPO contracts or other contracts, and to develop relationships with provider networks and new GPOs, we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed. 
 
Increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business.
 
Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business.  We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment.  Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.  Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.  
 
Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, include, among other things:
 



 



 



 







 




 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



Additionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall.  
 
Recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale.  We generally sell products to customers with payment terms.  If customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us.  Likewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms.  Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products and/or services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.
 
Our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.  Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.
 
The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.
 
The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.  A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including, but not limited to:
 







 




 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 
In addition, the Nasdaq Stock Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on Nasdaq.  Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.  In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies.  This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
The health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business.
 
The health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences.  In recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other things: trends toward managed care; consolidation of health care distribution companies; consolidation of health care manufacturers; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers, as well as growing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental officials.  Both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services, changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined.  If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. 
 
The implementation of the Health Care Reform Law could materially adversely affect our business.  
 
The Health Care Reform Law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage.  
 
The Health Care Reform Law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013, and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold.  However, with respect to the medical device excise tax, a two-year moratorium was imposed under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017, and on January 22, 2018 an additional two-year moratorium was imposed under Public Law No. 115-120, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2019.  The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance.  







 


 
The Health Care Reform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented.  In addition, the President is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law. Repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate.  Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it, including without limitation, by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the Health Care Reform Law.  On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Act, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law.  Further, in December 2018, a Texas federal court struck down the entire Health Care Reform Law, a ruling which is being appealed, and, if upheld, could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry.  The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan.
 
The implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business.
 
A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or Open Payments Program, imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to covered recipients (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.  Effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives must also be reported.
 
Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.  We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements, our compliance with these new rules imposes additional costs on us.
 
Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business.
 
Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products, and animal feed and supplements.  Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the FDC Act, as amended, and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act.  Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder: 
 



 



 



 







 




 



 



 



 



 



 
Applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment, and the importation and exportation of products.  Our business is also subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad.  The FDA and DEA have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities.
 
The failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our business.  There can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business.  The costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they may be modified, could be material.  Allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.  While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution.  If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses.  Non-compliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation.  
 
If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business. 
 
Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Health care fraud measures may implicate, for example, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices, and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billing related functionality. 
 
The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular 







 



 
states) under federal and state false claims laws, and who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.  Penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe.  For example, under the federal False Claims Act, violations may result in treble damages, plus civil penalties of up to $22,363 per claim, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties.  With respect to “anti-kickback laws,” violations of, for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Law may result in civil penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties.  Notably, effective October 24, 2018, a new federal anti-kickback law (the “Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018”) enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation, may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services, regardless of whether the services at issue involved addiction services, and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer.  Furthermore, the Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, clarifying that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.
 
With respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.
 
We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years. Our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results, including, without limitation, securities, antitrust and marketing laws and regulations. Failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of non‑compliance.  We may determine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters.  For example, one of our subsidiaries recently resolved an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software, which resulted in a consent order and fine.  Failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business.
 
While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.
 
The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings. The Cures Act, signed into law on December 13, 2016, amended the device definition to exclude certain software, including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria.  In December 2017, the FDA issued draft guidance documents describing its proposed interpretation of the statutory language regarding 







 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


which types of clinical decision support tools and other software are exempt from regulations as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.
 
Our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.  These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.  For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as HIPAA.  HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.  Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers.  Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements.  Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.
 
In addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted the GDPR, effective from May 25, 2018, which increased privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extended the scope or responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to Data Subjects or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe).  Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues.  Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data.  Among other things, the GDPR requires with respect to data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data.  While we expect we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR requirements, our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.
 







 


 
Various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The initiatives include, among others, programs that incentivize physicians and dentists, though Medicare’s MIPS, to use certified EHR technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements, including regarding quality, promoting interoperability, resource use, clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information.  Qualification for the MIPS incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by CMS and ONC.  These standards have been subject to change.
 
Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to MIPS and other incentive programs.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy the changing governmental standards.  If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, we are exposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act.  For example, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155 million settlement and 5-year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based on allegations that the vendor, by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the False Claims Act.  While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality.    Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Additionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important.  On September 6, 2017, the FDA issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information.  As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.
 
There may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care.
 
Our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business.
 
Global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business.  The risks that our global operations are subject to include, among other things: 
 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 







 




 



 



 



 



 



 



 
Our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks.
 
We have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future.  Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock.  Some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:
 



 



 



 



 
There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful.  Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following:
 



 



 



 



 



 
Our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.
 
We are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations, services, products and personnel of each company within our management policies, procedures and strategies.  We cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions.  To effectively manage our expected future growth, we must continue to manage successfully our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, working capital management and financial and operational controls.  If we fail in any of these areas, our business could be materially adversely affected.
 







 


 
If the Animal Health Spin-off or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Animal Health Spin-off are determined to be taxable in whole or in part, we and our stockholders may incur substantial tax liabilities.
In connection with the Animal Health Spin-off, we obtained an opinion of outside tax counsel that the Animal Health Spin-off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have not sought or obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on the tax consequences of the transaction. In addition, the tax opinion is subject to customary qualifications and assumptions, and is based on factual representations and undertakings. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, or any undertakings to be fully complied with, could affect the validity of the tax opinion. Moreover, an opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the conclusions set forth in the tax opinion. Even if the Animal Health Spin-off otherwise qualified as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may become taxable to us if certain events occur that affect either us or Covetrus. While Covetrus has agreed not to take certain actions that could cause the transaction not to qualify as a tax-free transaction and is generally obligated to indemnify us against any tax consequences if it breaches this agreement, the potential tax liabilities could have an adverse effect on us if we were not entitled to indemnification or if the indemnification obligations were not fulfilled. If the Animal Health Spin-off or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Animal Health Spin-off are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and/or our U.S. stockholders who participated in the Animal Health Spin-off could incur substantial U.S. federal income tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that we would be entitled to indemnification or that Covetrus would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify us for any such taxable gain. In addition, we and/or our stockholders who participated in the Animal Health Spin-off could incur tax costs in foreign jurisdictions in connection with the transaction, irrespective of whether the Animal Health Spin-off qualifies as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
The Animal Health Spin-off may not achieve the intended benefits and may expose us to potential risks and liabilities.
 
We completed the Animal Health Spin-off on February 7, 2019.  We undertook the transaction because, among other things, we believed that our animal health business could achieve greater growth by combining with Vets First Choice and that we could benefit from greater strategic focus of our resources and management efforts. We may not benefit as expected from the increased focus on our core business, strategic programs and objectives made possible by the Animal Health Spin-off. In addition, the value of the transaction may be reduced by potential liabilities related to post-closing adjustments and indemnities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
 
We face inherent risk of exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury.
 
Our business involves a risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products.  Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products.  As a result, we are subject to the potential risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities.  Additionally, as our private-label business continues to grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims.  Another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain.  In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials.  The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability.  In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful. We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with 







 



 
adequate protection.  A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.
 
Our technology segment depends upon continued software and e-services product development, technical support and successful marketing. 
 
Competition among companies supplying practice management software and/or e-services is intense and increasing.  Our future sales of practice management software and e-services will depend on, among other factors:
 



 



 



 
We cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software, software enhancements or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services will be released on time or accepted by the market.  Our software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released.  We cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software errors or bugs will not occur.  Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation.  We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections.  We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or e-services products.
 
We rely on third parties for certain technologically advanced products.
 
Some of our products contain technologically advanced components, including software, that are developed by third parties.  We may not be able to replace the functions provided by these third-party components or products if they become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions, or if they are not adequately maintained or updated. 
 
In addition, third-party suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our customers.  Alternate sources for the technology currently provided by third parties to us may not be available to us in a timely manner, and may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use or sell.  
 
Further, the risk of intellectual property infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our business to include more technologically advanced products and continue to incorporate third party components, software and/or other intellectual property into the products we sell.  Also, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology.  Any infringement action brought against us or our customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.
 
The risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results and our reputation.  
 
We may experience competition from third-party online commerce sites.
 
Traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions.  The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis.  The emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.







 


 
Security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time.
 
We rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store data to, among other things:
 



 



 



 



 



 
Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our IS security systems causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
 
In addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.   In particular, certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws and regulations, such as HIPAA, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses. 
 
Regarding direct customer claims, although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges, or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases.
 
In addition, our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems, and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to an IS security breach.  Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services.
 
Risks associated with these and other IS security breaches may include, among other things:
 



 



 



 







 




 



 
We also deliver Internet-based services and, accordingly, depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the Internet.  In the event of any difficulties, outages and delays by Internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing such services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.
 
We have various insurance policies, including cyber liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.  Successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.
 
Certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.
 
The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  These provisions, among other things:
 



 



 
In addition, our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control.  These incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter, and certain other awards made under these incentive plans (such as restricted stock/unit awards) accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control.  Further, certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason, in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control.
 
Tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.  
 
We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions.  From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives.  On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Act into law, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions.  In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.
 








 


 
Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments
 
We have no unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2018 fiscal year.








 


 
ITEM 2.  Properties
 
We own or lease the following properties with more than 100,000 square feet: 
  



 
The properties listed in the table above are our principal properties primarily used by our health care distribution segment.  In addition, we lease numerous other distribution, office, showroom, manufacturing and sales space in locations including the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
 
We believe that our properties are in good condition, are well maintained and are suitable and adequate to carry on our business.  We have additional operating capacity at certain distribution center facilities.








 


 
ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings  
 
 
Beginning in January 2016, purported class action complaints were filed against Patterson Companies, Inc. (“Patterson”), Benco Dental Supply Co. (“Benco”) and Henry Schein, Inc. Although there were factual and legal variations among these complaints, each of these complaints alleges, among other things, that defendants conspired to fix prices, allocate customers and foreclose competitors by boycotting manufacturers, state dental associations and others that deal with defendants’ competitors.  On February 9, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York ordered all of these actions, and all other actions filed thereafter asserting substantially similar claims against defendants, consolidated for pre-trial purposes.  On February 26, 2016, a consolidated class action complaint was filed by Arnell Prato, D.D.S., P.L.L.C., d/b/a Down to Earth Dental, Evolution Dental Sciences, LLC, Howard M. May, DDS, P.C., Casey Nelson, D.D.S., Jim Peck, D.D.S., Bernard W. Kurek, D.M.D., Larchmont Dental Associates, P.C., and Keith Schwartz, D.M.D., P.A. (collectively, “putative class representatives”) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, entitled In re Dental Supplies Antitrust Litigation, Civil Action No. 1:16-CV-00696-BMC-GRB.  In the consolidated class action complaint, putative class representatives allege a nationwide agreement among Henry Schein, Benco, Patterson and non-party Burkhart Dental Supply Company, Inc. (“Burkhart”) not to compete on price. The consolidated class action complaint asserts a single count under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seeks equitable relief, compensatory and treble damages, jointly and severally, and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees.  On September 28, 2018, the parties executed a settlement agreement that proposes, subject to court approval, a full and final settlement of the lawsuit on a classwide basis.  Subject to certain exceptions, the settlement class consists of all persons or entities that purchased dental products directly from Henry Schein, Patterson, Benco, Burkhart, or any combination thereof, during the period August 31, 2008 through and including March 31, 2016.  As a result, we recorded a charge of $38.5 million in our third quarter 2018 results.   
 
On August 31, 2012, Archer and White Sales, Inc. (“Archer”) filed a complaint against Henry Schein, Inc. as well as Danaher Corporation and its subsidiaries Instrumentarium Dental, Inc., Dental Equipment, LLC, Kavo Dental Technologies, LLC and Dental Imaging Technologies Corporation (collectively, the “Danaher Defendants”) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Civil Action No. 2:12-CV-00572-JRG, styled as an antitrust action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and the Texas Free Enterprise Antitrust Act.  Archer alleges a conspiracy between Henry Schein, an unnamed company and the Danaher Defendants to terminate or limit Archer’s distribution rights.  On August 1, 2017, Archer filed an amended complaint, adding Patterson and Benco as defendants, and alleging that Henry Schein, Patterson, Benco and Burkhart conspired to fix prices and refused to compete with each other for sales of dental equipment to dental professionals and agreed to enlist their common suppliers, the Danaher Defendants, to join a price-fixing conspiracy and boycott by reducing the distribution territory of, and eventually terminating, their price-cutting competing distributor Archer.  Archer seeks damages in an amount to be proved at trial, to be trebled with interest and costs, including attorneys’ fees, jointly and severally, as well as injunctive relief.  On October 30, 2017, Archer filed a second amended complaint, to add additional allegations that it believes support its claims.  The named parties and causes of action are the same as the August 1, 2017 amended complaint.  
 
On October 1, 2012, we filed a motion for an order: (i) compelling Archer to arbitrate its claims against us; (2) staying all proceedings pending arbitration; and (3) joining the Danaher Defendants’ motion to arbitrate and stay.  On May 28, 2013, the Magistrate Judge granted the motions to arbitrate and stayed proceedings pending arbitration.  On June 10, 2013, Archer moved for reconsideration before the District Court judge.  On December 7, 2016, the District Court Judge granted Archer’s motion for reconsideration and lifted the stay.  Defendants appealed the District Court’s order.  On December 21, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s order denying the motions to compel arbitration.  On February 12, 2018, defendants filed an Application for Stay of Proceedings in the District Court in the Supreme Court of the United States, seeking to stay proceedings in the District Court pending a decision on defendants’ forthcoming petition for writ of certiorari.  On June 25, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States granted defendants’ petition for writ of certiorari. On October 29, 2018, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments.  On January 8, 2019, the Supreme Court issued its published decision vacating the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and remanding the case to the Fifth Circuit for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court’s opinion.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. 







 


 
On August 17, 2017, IQ Dental Supply, Inc. (“IQ Dental”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, entitled IQ Dental Supply, Inc. v. Henry Schein, Inc., Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company, Case No. 2:17-cv-4834.  Plaintiff alleges that it is a distributor of dental supplies and equipment, and sells dental products through an online dental distribution platform operated by SourceOne Dental (“SourceOne”).  SourceOne had previously brought an antitrust lawsuit against Henry Schein, Patterson and Benco, which Henry Schein settled in the second quarter of 2017 and which is described in our prior filings with the SEC.
 
IQ Dental alleges, among other things, that defendants conspired to suppress competition from IQ Dental and SourceOne for the marketing, distribution and sale of dental supplies and equipment in the United States, and that defendants unlawfully agreed with one another to boycott dentists, manufacturers and state dental associations that deal with, or considered dealing with, plaintiff and SourceOne.  Plaintiff claims that this alleged conduct constitutes unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, New York’s Donnelly Act and the New Jersey Antitrust Act, and also makes pendant state law claims for tortious interference with prospective business relations, civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting.  Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, compensatory, treble and punitive damages, jointly and severally, and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees.  On December 21, 2017, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss.  On January 19, 2018, IQ Dental appealed the District Court’s order.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral argument on the appeal on September 13, 2018.  The court’s decision is pending.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action.
 
On February 12, 2018, the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed a complaint against Benco Dental Supply Co., Henry Schein, Inc. and Patterson Companies, Inc.  The FTC alleges, among other things, that defendants violated U.S. antitrust laws by conspiring, and entering into an agreement, to refuse to provide discounts to or otherwise serve buying groups representing dental practitioners.  The FTC alleges that defendants conspired in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.  The complaint seeks equitable relief only and does not seek monetary damages.  We deny the allegation that we conspired to refuse to provide discounts to or otherwise serve dental buying groups and intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. A hearing before an administrative law judge began on October 16, 2018 and is ongoing.  We believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
 
On March 7, 2018, Joseph Salkowitz, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint for violation of the federal securities laws against Henry Schein, Inc., Stanley M. Bergman and Steven Paladino in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Case No. 1:18-cv-01428.  The complaint sought to certify a class consisting of all persons and entities who, subject to certain exclusions, purchased Henry Schein securities from March 7, 2013 through February 12, 2018 (the “Class Period”).  The complaint alleged, among other things, that the defendants had made materially false and misleading statements about Henry Schein’s business, operations and prospects during the Class Period, including matters relating to the issues in the antitrust class action and the FTC action described above, thereby causing the plaintiff and members of the purported class to pay artificially inflated prices for Henry Schein securities.  The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”), the court appointed lead plaintiff and lead counsel on June 22, 2018 and recaptioned the putative class action as In re Henry Schein, Inc. Securities Litigation, under the same case number.  Lead plaintiff filed a consolidated class action complaint on September 14, 2018.  The consolidated class action complaint asserts similar claims against the same defendants (plus Timothy Sullivan) on behalf of the same putative class of purchasers during the Class Period.  It alleges that Henry Schein’s stock price was inflated during that period because Henry Schein had misleadingly portrayed its dental-distribution business “as successfully producing excellent profits while operating in a highly competitive environment” even though, “in reality, [Henry Schein] had engaged for years in collusive and anticompetitive practices in order to maintain Schein’s margins, profits, and market share.”  The complaint alleges that the stock price started to fall from August 8, 2017, when the company announced below-expected financial performance that allegedly “revealed that Schein’s poor results were a product of abandoning prior attempts to inflate sales volume and margins through anticompetitive collusion,” through February 13, 2018, after the FTC filed a complaint against Benco, Henry Schein and Patterson alleging that they 







 



 
violated U.S. antitrust laws.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. Henry Schein has also received a request under 8 Del. C. § 220 to inspect corporate books and records relating to the issues raised in the securities class action and the antitrust matters discussed above.
On May 3, 2018, a purported class action complaint, Marion Diagnostic Center, LLC, et al. v. Becton, Dickinson, and Co., et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-010509, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois against Becton, Dickinson, and Co. (“Becton”); Premier, Inc. (“Premier”), Vizient, Inc. (“Vizient”), Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”), Owens & Minor Inc. (“O&M”), Henry Schein, Inc., and Unnamed Becton Distributor Co-Conspirators.  The complaint alleges that the defendants entered into a vertical conspiracy to force healthcare providers into long-term exclusionary contracts that restrain trade in the nationwide markets for conventional and safety syringes and safety IV catheters and inflate the prices of certain Becton products to above-competitive levels.  The named plaintiffs seek to represent three separate classes consisting of all healthcare providers that purchased (i) Becton’s conventional syringes, (ii) Becton’s safety syringes, or (iii) Becton’s safety catheters directly from Becton, Premier, Vizient, Cardinal, O&M or Henry Schein on or after May 3, 2014.  The complaint asserts a single count under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seeks equitable relief, treble damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs and expenses, and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.  On June 15, 2018, an amended complaint was filed asserting the same allegations against the same parties and adding McKesson Medical-Surgical, Inc. as an additional defendant.  On November 30, 2018, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss and entered a final judgment, dismissing plaintiffs’ complaint with prejudice.  On December 27, 2018, plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action.
 
On May 29, 2018, an amended complaint was filed in the MultiDistrict Litigation (“MDL”) proceeding In Re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804; Case No. 17-md-2804) in an action entitled The County of Summit, Ohio et al. v. Purdue Pharma, L.P., et al., Civil Action No. 1:18-op-45090-DAP (“County of  Summit Action”), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, adding Henry Schein, Inc., Henry Schein Medical Systems, Inc. and others as defendants.  Plaintiffs allege that manufacturers of prescription opioid drugs engaged in a false advertising campaign to expand the market for such drugs and their own market share and that the entities in the supply chain (including Henry Schein, Inc. and Henry Schein Medical Systems, Inc.) reaped financial rewards by refusing or otherwise failing to monitor appropriately and restrict the improper distribution of those drugs.  Plaintiffs assert the following claims for relief against Henry Schein, Inc. and Henry Schein Medical Systems, Inc.: statutory public nuisance; common law absolute public nuisance; negligence; injury through criminal acts (R.C. 2307.60); unjust enrichment; and civil conspiracy.   This case has been designated “Track 1” and is currently set for trial on October 21, 2019.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. 
 
In addition to the Summit County Action, Henry Schein and/or one or more of its affiliated companies have currently been named as a defendant in twenty-one (21) additional lawsuits, which allege claims similar to those alleged in the Summit County Action.  None of these other cases have been set for trial.  These actions consist of some that have been consolidated within the MDL and are currently abated for discovery purposes, and others which remain pending in state courts and are proceeding independently and outside of the MDL.   Sales of opioids in North America from October 2017 through October 2018 were less than 1% of all North American sales.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these actions.
 
On October 9, 2018, a purported class action complaint entitled Kramer v. Henry Schein, Inc., Patterson Co., Inc., Benco Dental Supply Co., and Unnamed Co-Conspirators, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  The complaint alleges that members of the proposed class, comprised of purchasers of dental services from dental practices in California, suffered antitrust injury due to an unlawful boycott, price-fixing or otherwise anticompetitive conspiracy among Henry Schein, Patterson and Benco.  The complaint alleges that the alleged conspiracy overcharged California dental practices, orthodontic practices and dental laboratories on their purchase of dental supplies, which in turn passed on some or all of such overcharges to members of the California class purchasing dental services.  Subject to certain exclusions, the complaint defines the class as “all persons residing in California purchasing and/or reimbursing for dental services from California dental practices on or after August 31, 2012.” The complaint alleges violations of California antitrust laws, including the Cartwright Act (Cal. Bus. and Prof. Code § 16720) and the Unfair Competition Act (Cal. Bus. and Prof. Code § 17200), and seeks a 







 



 
permanent injunction, actual damages to be determined at trial, trebled, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest.  On December 7, 2018, an amended complaint was filed asserting the same claims against the same parties.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action.
 
On January 29, 2019, a purported class action complaint was filed by R. Lawrence Hatchett, M.D. against Henry Schein, Inc., Patterson Co., Inc., Benco Dental Supply Co., and unnamed co-conspirators in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.  The complaint alleges that members of the proposed class suffered antitrust injury due to an unlawful boycott, price-fixing or otherwise anticompetitive conspiracy among Henry Schein, Patterson and Benco. The complaint alleges that the alleged conspiracy overcharged Illinois dental practices, orthodontic practices and dental laboratories on their purchase of dental supplies, which in turn passed on some or all of such overcharges to members of the class.  Subject to certain exclusions, the complaint defines the class as “all persons residing in Illinois purchasing and/or reimbursing for dental care provided by independent Illinois dental practices purchasing dental supplies from the defendants, or purchasing from buying groups purchasing these supplies from the defendants, on or after January 29, 2015.”  The complaint alleges violations of the Illinois Antitrust Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. §§ 10/3(2), 10/7(2), and seeks a permanent injunction, actual damages to be determined at trial, trebled, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action.
  
From time to time, we may become a party to other legal proceedings, including, without limitation, product liability claims, employment matters, commercial disputes, governmental inquiries and investigations (which may in some cases involve our entering into settlement arrangements or consent decrees), and other matters arising out of the ordinary course of our business.  While the results of any legal proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty, in our opinion none of these other pending matters are currently anticipated to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
 
As of December 29, 2018, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to claims that were probable to result in liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss.  This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other factors, including probable recoveries from third parties.

ITEM 5.   Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
 
On August 16, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of our common stock.  Each Henry Schein, Inc. stockholder of record at the close of business on September 1, 2017 received a distribution of one additional share for every share held. Trading began on a split-adjusted basis on September 15, 2017.  
 
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol HSIC.  On October 2, 2007, our common stock became a component of the Nasdaq -100 stock market index.  
 
On February 12, 2019, there were approximately 324 holders of record of our common stock and the last reported sales price was $61.01.
 
Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer
 
Our share repurchase program, announced on June 21, 2004, originally allowed us to repurchase up to $100 million of shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 3.5% of the shares outstanding at the commencement of the program.  As summarized in the table below, subsequent additional increases totaling $3.2 billion, authorized by our Board of Directors, to the repurchase program provide for a total of $3.3 billion of shares of our common stock to be repurchased under this program.
  



 
As of December 29, 2018, we had repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of common stock (58,189,377 shares) under these initiatives, with $400.0 million available for future common stock share repurchases.
 







 


 
The following table summarizes repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2018:
  



 
Dividend Policy
 
We have not declared any cash or stock dividends on our common stock during fiscal years 2018 or 2017.  We currently do not anticipate declaring any cash or stock dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.  We intend to retain earnings to finance the expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes, including our share repurchase program.  Any declaration of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends and other factors.

We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs.  Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.
 
We conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.
 
The health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental and medical operating segments.  This segment distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.  Our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  Our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics.  Our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.
 
Our global technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  Our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners.  Our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners.
 
Spin-Off of Henry Schein Animal Health Business
 
On February 7, 2019 (the “Distribution Date”), we completed the previously announced separation (the “Separation”) and subsequent merger of our animal health business (the “Henry Schein Animal Health Business”) with Direct Vet Marketing, Inc. (d/b/a Vets First Choice, “Vets First Choice”) (the “Merger”).  This was accomplished by a series of transactions among us, Vets First Choice, Covetrus, Inc. (f/k/a HS Spinco, Inc. “Covetrus”), a wholly owned subsidiary of ours prior to the Distribution Date, and HS Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Covetrus (“Merger Sub”).  In connection with the Separation, we contributed, assigned and transferred to Covetrus certain applicable assets, liabilities and capital stock or other ownership interests relating to the Henry Schein Animal Health Business.  On the Distribution Date, we received a tax-free distribution of $1,120.0 million from Covetrus pursuant to certain debt financing incurred by Covetrus.  On the Distribution Date and prior to the Distribution, Covetrus issued shares of Covetrus common stock to certain institutional accredited investors (the “Share Sale Investors”) for $361.1 million (the “Share Sale”).  The proceeds of the Share Sale were paid to Covetrus and distributed to us.  Subsequent to the Share Sale, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of the common stock of Covetrus held by us to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2019 (the “Animal Health Spin-off”).  After the Share Sale and Animal Health Spin-off, Merger Sub consummated the Merger whereby it merged with and into Vets First Choice, with Vets First Choice surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Covetrus.  Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, on a fully diluted basis, (i) approximately 63% of the shares of Covetrus common stock were (a) owned by our stockholders and the Share Sale Investors, and (b) in respect of certain equity awards held by certain employees of the Henry Schein Animal Health Business, and (ii) approximately 37% of the shares of Covetrus common stock were (a) owned by stockholders of Vets First Choice immediately prior to the Merger, and (b) in respect of certain equity awards held by certain employees of Vets First Choice.  After the Separation and the Merger, we no longer beneficially owned any shares of Covetrus common stock and, following the Distribution Date, will not consolidate the financial results of Covetrus for the purpose of our financial reporting.  Following the Separation and the Merger, Covetrus was an independent, publicly traded company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
 







 


 
Effective first quarter 2019, we will report the historical earnings of the Henry Schein Animal Health Business as a discontinued operation.  The Company estimates that on a continuing operations basis, its 2018 revenues were $9.4 billion and its 2018 net income was $430.7 million.
 
Industry Overview
 
In recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.
 
Our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the health care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.
 
Our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty, particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services.
 
Industry Consolidation
 
The health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and diverse.  The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.
 
Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.
 
The trend of consolidation extends to our customer base.  Health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician hospital organizations.  In many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices.
 
We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.
 
Our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  This trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses.
 
As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this.  We also have invested in expanding our 







 



 
sales/marketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the office-based practitioner setting.
 
As the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued.  If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.
 
Aging Population and Other Market Influences   
 
The health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage.  In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices.
 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Data Base, in 2018 there were more than six million Americans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care and elder-care services.  By the year 2050, that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 19 million.  The population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 50% during the same time period.
 
As a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the United States.  We believe that demand for our products and services will grow, while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating, economic and industry conditions.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS,  published “National Health Expenditure Projections 2017-2026” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately $3.7 trillion in 2018, or 18.2% of the nation’s gross domestic product, the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the United States.  Health care spending is projected to reach approximately $5.7 trillion in 2026, approximately 19.7% of the nation’s gross domestic product.
 
Government
 
Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care, and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and/or medical treatments or services.  Also, many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance.  In addition, our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance, including securities, antitrust, anti-bribery and anti-kickback, customer interaction transparency, data privacy, data security and other laws and regulations.  Failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Health Care Reform
 
The United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010 (the “Health Care Reform Law”) increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage.
 
The Health Care Reform Law requirements include a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales.  However, with respect to the medical device excise tax, a two-year moratorium was imposed under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 







 



 
2017, and on January 22, 2018 an additional two-year moratorium was imposed under Public Law No. 115-120, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2019.  The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance.  The Health Care Reform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented.  
 
In addition, the President is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law.  Repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate.  Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it, including, without limitation, by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the Health Care Reform Law.  On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions, and which also repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law.  Further, in December 2018, a Texas federal court struck down the entire Health Care Reform Law, a ruling which is being appealed, and if upheld, could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry.  The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan.
 
A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.  Effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives must also be reported.
 
Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.  We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements, our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us.
 
Another notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), enacted on April 16, 2015, established a new payment framework, called the Quality Payment Program, which modifies certain Medicare payments to “eligible clinicians,” including physicians, dentists and other practitioners.  Under MACRA, certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in Medicare through the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) or Advanced Alternative Payment Models (“APMs”).  MIPS generally consolidated three programs; the physician quality reporting system, the value-based payment modifier and the Medicare electronic health record (“EHR”) program, into a single program in which Medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality, promoting interoperability, resource use, clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information.  Advanced APMs generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk.    The first MIPS performance year was 2017, and the data collected in the first performance year determines payment adjustments beginning January 1, 2019.  MACRA represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations.  The implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace.  MACRA may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment, leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base.  Although we believe that we are 







 



 
positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this.
 
Health Care Fraud
 
Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.
 
The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws, and who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.  Penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe.  For example, under the federal False Claims Act, violations may result in treble damages, plus civil penalties of up to $22,363 per claim, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties.  With respect to “anti-kickback laws,” violations of, for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Law may result in civil penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties.  Notably, effective October 24, 2018, a new federal anti-kickback law (the “Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018”) enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation, may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services, regardless of whether the services at issue involved addition services, and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer.  Furthermore, the Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, clarifying that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.
 
With respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.
 
We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.
 
Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance.
 
While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.







 
 

 

 
Operating, Security and Licensure Standards
 
Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Among the United States federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (“FDC Act”), and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.  We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations.
 
The FDC Act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state.  Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as “HCT/P products.”
 
The Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and pre-empts state law.  Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), is being phased in over a period of ten years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.  The law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, and continues to be implemented.  The DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the DSCSA requirements.  
 
The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers (“3PLs”), and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities.  The DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs.  According to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area.  Current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the FDA issues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA.
 
We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable DSCSA requirements.
 
The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification (“UDI”) system.  The FDA is phasing in the implementation of the UDI regulations over seven years, generally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices.  Most compliance dates were reached as of September 24, 2018, with a final set of requirements for low risk devices being reach on September 24, 2022, which will complete the phase in.  The UDI regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers (“UDIs”), with a content and format prescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited issuing agency, on the labels and packages of medical devices, and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs.  The UDI regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA, much of which information is publicly available on an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database.   The UDI regulations provide for certain exceptions, alternatives and time extensions.  For example, the UDI regulations include a general exception for Class I devices exempt from the Quality System Regulation (other than record-keeping requirements and complaint files).  Regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers, repackagers, reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified, with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label, and include certain of our businesses.
 
We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable UDI requirements.







 


 
Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) permitting us to handle controlled substances.  We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.  We are subject to inspection by the DEA.
 
Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale.  These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment.  In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example, human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue.  We are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products.  The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.  Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers.  Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell, which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm.  Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation.
 
Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions.
 
Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors.
 
Antitrust
 
The U.S. federal government, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive.  Violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties.  Private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages.
 
Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records
 
The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings.  The 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”), signed into law on December 13, 2016, amended the device definition to exclude certain software, including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria.  In December 2017, the FCA issued draft guidance documents describing its proposed interpretation of the statutory language regarding which types of clinical decision support tools and other software are exempt from regulation as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.
 
In addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted a new pan-European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), effective from May 25, 2018, which increased privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes 







 



 
increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in Europe (“Data Subjects”) or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe).  Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues.  Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data.  Among other things, the GDPR requires with respect to data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data.  While we expect we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR requirements, our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.
 
Various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The initiatives include, among others, programs that incentivize physicians and dentists, through Medicare’s MIPS, to use certified EHR technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements. Including regarding quality, promoting interoperability, resource use, clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information.  Qualification for the MIPS incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by CMS and by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (“ONC”) of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”).   These standards have been subject to change.
 
Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to MIPS and other incentive programs.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy the changing governmental standards.  If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments we are exposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act.  For example, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155 million settlement and 5-year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based on allegations that the vendor, by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the False Claims Act.  While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality.  Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers. Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice 







 



 
management products that must meet these requirements. Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial 
fines, penalties, and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.
 
Additionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important.  On September 6, 2017, the FDA issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information.  As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.
 
There may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care.
 
E-Commerce
 
Electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships.  Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition.  The continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.
 
Through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives.  We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business.  We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.

Plans of Restructuring
 
On July 9, 2018, we committed to an initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies. These actions will allow us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure and fund new initiatives that are expected to drive future growth under our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan.  This initiative is expected to include the elimination of approximately 2% to 3% of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities.  The total 2018 costs associated with the actions to complete this restructuring were initially expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million.  However, additional cost savings opportunities were identified in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting in a charge of $35.4 million in the quarter, which increased our full year 2018 restructuring charges to $62.9 million, consisting primarily of severance costs. 
 
We plan to continue restructuring activities in the first half of 2019 and expect to incur additional restructuring costs related to these activities during the first half of 2019.  At this time we are identifying specific opportunities and cannot reasonably estimate the amount of additional restructuring costs in 2019.
 
On November 6, 2014, we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies, which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015.  This initiative originally planned for the elimination of approximately 2% to 3% of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities.  We subsequently announced our plan to extend these restructuring activities through the end of 2016 to further implement cost-savings initiatives, which ultimately resulted in the elimination of approximately 900 positions, representing slightly more than 4% of our workforce.  The total costs associated with the actions for this restructuring included $34.9 million pre-tax, which was recorded in fiscal 2015, and $45.9 million pre-tax, which was recorded in fiscal 2016.  
 
The costs associated with these restructurings are included in a separate line item, “Restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income.
  







 


 
2018 Compared to 2017
 
Net Sales
 
Net sales for 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands):
  



 
The $740.5 million, or 5.9%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 29, 2018 includes an increase of 5.2% local currency growth (3.4% increase in internally generated revenue and 1.8% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 0.7% related to foreign currency exchange.
 
The $300.1 million, or 5.0%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 29, 2018 includes an increase of 4.2% in local currencies (3.0% increase in internally generated revenue and 1.2% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 0.8% related to foreign currency exchange.  The 4.2% increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 2.6% (2.5% increase in internally generated revenue and 0.1% growth from acquisitions) and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 4.8% (3.2% increase in internally generated revenue and 1.6% growth from acquisitions). 
 
The $206.0 million, or 5.9%, increase in animal health net sales for the year ended December 29, 2018 includes an increase of 4.6% local currency growth (2.1% increase in internally generated revenue and 2.5% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 1.3% related to foreign currency exchange.  The growth in internally generated animal health revenue is affected by year-over-year changes to certain supplier agreements where we acted as an agent in 2018 versus acting as a principal in the prior year.  When excluding the effects of this change, internally generated revenue grew by 5.4%.  As indicated above, we completed the Animal Health Spin-off on February 7, 2019.
 
The $163.2 million, or 6.5%, increase in medical net sales for the year ended December 29, 2018 includes an increase of 6.4% local currency growth (6.3% increase in internally generated revenue and 0.1% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 0.1% related to foreign currency exchange.
 
The $71.1 million, or 16.2%, increase in technology and value-added services net sales for the year ended December 29, 2018 includes an increase of 15.8% local currency growth (3.5% increase in internally generated revenue and 12.3% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 0.4% related to foreign currency exchange.
 







 


 
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit and gross margins for 2018 and 2017 by segment and in total were as follows (in thousands):
  



 
Gross profit increased $196.0 million, or 5.8%, for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to the prior year period.  As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  Additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment.  These higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services, as well as certain financial services. The software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development.
 
Within our health care distribution segment, gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next.  Changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin.  For example, sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products.  Conversely, sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average.  With respect to customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to office-based practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies.
 
Health care distribution gross profit increased $141.0 million, or 4.5%, for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to the prior year period.  Health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 25.6% for the year ended December 29, 2018 from 25.9% for the comparable prior year period.  The overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is attributable to a $128.9 million gross profit increase from growth in internally generated revenue and $49.4 million is attributable to acquisitions.  These increases were partially offset by a $37.3 million decline in gross profit due to the decrease in the gross margin rates.  
 
Technology and value-added services gross profit increased $55.0 million, or 19.2%, for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to the prior year period.  Technology and value-added services gross profit margin increased to 67.1% for the year ended December 29, 2018 from 65.4% for the comparable prior year period.  Acquisitions accounted for $45.2 million of our gross profit increase within our technology and value-added services segment for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to the prior year period. The remaining increase of $9.8 million in our technology and value-added services segment gross profit was primarily attributable to $11.4 million growth in internally generated revenue, partially offset by $1.6 million related to gross margin rates.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses by segment and in total for 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands):
  



 
Selling, general and administrative expenses (together with litigation settlements, transaction costs related to the Animal Health spin-off and restructuring costs) increased $302.3 million, or 11.9%, to $2,842.0 million for the year ended December 29, 2018 from the comparable prior year period.  The $250.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses within our health care distribution segment for the year ended December 29, 







 



 
2018 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to $209.3 million of additional operating costs (including an increase of $33.2 million for litigation settlements, $38.8 million of transaction costs related to the Animal Health spin-off and $59.1 million of restructuring costs) and $41.4 million of additional costs from acquired companies.  The $51.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses within our technology and value-added services segment for the year ended December 29, 2018 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to $45.6 million of additional costs from acquired companies and $6.0 million of additional operating costs.  As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 21.5% from 20.4% for the comparable prior year period.
 
As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, selling expenses increased $90.3 million, or 5.8%, to $1,653.7 million for the year ended December 29, 2018 from the comparable prior year period.  As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses remained consistent at 12.5%.  
 
As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, general and administrative expenses increased $212.0 million, or 21.7%, to $1,188.3 million for the year ended December 29, 2018 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to an increase of $33.2 million for litigation settlements, $38.8 million of transaction costs related to the Animal Health spin-off and $59.1 million of restructuring costs.  As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 9.0% from 7.8% for the comparable prior year period.
 
Other Expense, Net
 
Other expense, net for the years ended 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in thousands):
  



 
Other expense, net increased $21.2 million to $57.7 million for the year ended December 29, 2018 from the comparable prior year period.  Interest income increased $3.7 million primarily due to increased investment and late fee income.  Interest expense increased $25.1 million primarily due to increased borrowings under our bank credit lines and our private placement facilities primarily to fund acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, as well as higher interest rates.  
 
Income Taxes
 
For the year ended December 29, 2018, our effective tax rate was 22.4% compared to 44.1% for the prior year period.  In 2018, our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a reduction in the estimate of our transition tax associated with the Tax Act, tax charges and credits associated with legal entity reorganizations outside the U.S., and state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.  In 2017, our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the Tax Act, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, “Stock Compensation” (Topic 718) (“ASU 2016-09”), as well as state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Act.  The Tax Act is comprehensive tax legislation that implemented complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, modification of accelerated depreciation, the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and changes to the limitations of the deductibility of interest.  Additionally, the Tax Act moved from a global tax regime to a modified territorial regime, which requires U.S. companies to pay a mandatory one-time transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S.  The transition tax is payable over eight years.  The Tax Act also included provisions to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), a beneficial tax rate foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”), a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) that imposes tax on certain foreign related-party payments, and IRC Section 163(j) interest limitation (Interest Limitation).  We became subject to the GILTI, FDII, BEAT and Interest Limitation provisions effective January 1, 2018.  







 


 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. We elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.  Under Topic 740, we estimated the impact of each provision of the Tax Act on our effective tax and recorded a current tax expense for the GILTI provision of $7.5 million in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 29, 2018.  For the BEAT, FDII and Interest Limitation computations, we have not recorded an estimate in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 29, 2018 because we have concluded that these provisions of the Tax Act will not apply to us or will have an immaterial impact in 2018.
Due to the complexities of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) that allowed the company to record a provisional amount for any income tax effects of the Tax Act in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, to the extent that a reasonable estimate can be made, in its 2017 financial statements.  SAB 118 allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts.    In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts related to the Tax Act for any items that could be reasonably estimated at the time.  This included the one-time transition tax that we estimated to be $140.0 million and a net deferred tax expense of $3.0 million attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the lower enacted federal income tax rate of 21%.  Within our consolidated balance sheets, $27.4 million was included in “Accrued taxes” and $112.6 million was included in “Other liabilities”.  In the aggregate, for the quarter ended December 30, 2017, these Tax Act modifications resulted in a one-time tax expense of approximately $143.0million.  Absent the effects of the transition tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 30, 2017 would have been 26.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 44.1%.  
For the year ended December 29, 2018 we have recorded a net $10.0 million reduction to the one-time transition tax and an additional $1.7 million net deferred tax benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate.  Within our consolidated balance sheets, $9.9 million is included in “Accrued taxes” and $104.2 million is included in “Other liabilities” for the transition tax.  The changes were a result of additional analysis, changes in interpretation and assumptions, as well as additional regulatory guidance that was issued.  As of December 29, 2018, the Company has completed its analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in accordance with SAB 118 and the amounts are now considered final.
 
Net Income
 
Net income increased $102.8 million, or 22.4%, for the year ended December 29, 2018, compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above.







 


 
2017 Compared to 2016
 
Net Sales
 
Net sales for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):
  



 
The fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of 53 weeks.
 
The $889.9 million, or 7.7%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 7.2% local currency growth (5.1% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.5% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 3.6% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 0.5% related to foreign currency exchange.
 
The $493.5 million, or 8.9%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 7.9% in local currencies (3.0% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.4% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 6.3% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 1.0% related to foreign currency exchange.  The 7.9% increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 4.5% (6.5% increase in internally generated revenue, 2.4% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 0.4% growth from acquisitions) and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 9.0% (1.9% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.1% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 8.2% growth from acquisitions). 
 
The $223.6 million, or 6.9%, increase in animal health net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 6.9% local currency growth (6.3% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.3% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 1.9% growth from acquisitions).  The growth in internally generated animal health revenue is affected by the revenue for certain products being recognized on a gross basis in 2017 that had been recognized on an agency basis in the prior year.  When excluding the effects of this change, internally generated revenue grew by 6.0%.  As indicated above, we completed the Animal Health Spin-off on February 7, 2019.
 
The $160.3 million, or 6.9%, increase in medical net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 6.8% local currency growth (8.4% increase in internally generated revenue and 1.6% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016) as well as an increase of 0.1% related to foreign currency exchange.
 
The $12.5 million, or 2.9%, increase in technology and value-added services net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 3.2% local currency growth (3.5% increase in internally generated revenue, 0.8% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 0.5% growth from acquisitions) partially offset by a decrease of 0.3% related to foreign currency exchange.
 







 


 
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit and gross margins for 2017 and 2016 by segment and in total were as follows (in thousands):
  



 
Gross profit increased $172.6 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period.  As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  Additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment.  These higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services, as well as certain financial services. The software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development.

Health care distribution gross profit increased $159.3 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period.  Health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 25.9% for the year ended December 30, 2017 from 26.5% for the comparable prior year period.  The overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is attributable to a $104.0 million gross profit increase from growth in internally generated revenue and $125.3 million is attributable to acquisitions.  These increases were partially offset by a $70.0 million decline in gross profit due to the decrease in the gross margin rates. 
 
Technology and value-added services gross profit increased $13.3 million, or 4.9%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period.  Technology and value-added services gross profit margin increased to 65.4% for the year ended December 30, 2017 from 64.2% for the comparable prior year period.  Acquisitions accounted for $2.0 million of our gross profit increase within our technology and value-added services segment for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period. The remaining increase of $11.3 million in our technology and value-added services segment gross profit was primarily attributable to growth in internally generated revenue and the increase in gross margin rates.
 
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses by segment and in total for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):
  



 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $130.7 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 from the comparable prior year period.  The $127.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses within our health care distribution segment for the year ended December 30, 2017 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to $107.3 million of additional costs from acquired companies, and $19.7 million 







 



 
of additional operating costs.  The $3.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses within our technology and value-added services segment for the year ended December 30, 2017 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to $2.1 million of additional costs from acquired companies and $1.6 million of additional operating costs.  As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 20.4% from 20.8% for the comparable prior year period.
 
As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, selling expenses increased $82.2 million, or 5.6%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 from the comparable prior year period.  As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses decreased to 12.5% from 12.8% for the comparable prior year period.  
 
As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, general and administrative expenses increased $48.5 million, or 5.2%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 from the comparable prior year period.  As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses decreased to 7.8% from 8.0% for the comparable prior year period.
 
Other Expense, Net
 
Other expense, net for the years ended 2017 and 2016 was as follows (in thousands):
  



 
Other expense, net increased $20.8 million to $36.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 from the comparable prior year period.  Interest income increased $4.3 million primarily due to increased investment and late fee income.  Interest expense increased $21.8 million primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates under our bank credit lines and interest expense related to a financing arrangement entered into during the first quarter of 2017 in Brazil.  Other, net decreased by $3.3 million due primarily to investment proceeds received in the first quarter of 2016.
 
Income Taxes
 
For the year ended December 30, 2017, our effective tax rate was 44.1% compared to 28.8% for the prior year period.  Our effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily higher due to the Tax Act.  Our effective tax rate was favorably impacted in 2017 by the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Accounting for Stock Compensation, as well as savings from implementation of tax planning initiatives and higher income from lower tax jurisdictions.   During the second quarter of 2016, the effective tax rate was affected by a federal tax audit settlement, which reduced our income tax expense by approximately $4.5 million.
 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Act.  The Tax Act is comprehensive tax legislation that implements complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, modification of accelerated depreciation, the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and changes to the limitations of the deductibility of interest.  Additionally, the Tax Act moved from a global tax regime to a modified territorial regime, which required U.S. companies to pay a mandatory one-time transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S.  The transition tax is payable over eight years.  
 
Due to the complexities of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 that allowed the company to record a provisional amount for any income tax effects of the Tax Act in accordance with ASC 740, to the extent that a reasonable estimate can be made.  SAB 118 allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts.
 







 


 
We have recorded provisional amounts for any items that could be reasonably estimated at that time.  This included the one-time transition tax that we estimated to be $140.0 million.  Within our consolidated balance sheets, $27.4 million is included in “Accrued taxes” and $112.6 million is included in “Other liabilities”.  The U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued due to the lower enacted federal income tax rate, of 21%, that was effective January 1, 2018.  The Company accrued a net deferred tax expense of $3.0 million attributable to the revaluation.  In the aggregate, for the quarter ended December 30, 2017, these Tax Act modifications resulted in a one-time tax expense of approximately $143.0 million.  Absent the effects of the transition tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 30, 2017 would have been 26.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 44.1%.
  
 
Net Income
 
Net income decreased $97.1 million, or 17.5%, for the year ended December 30, 2017, compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above.







 


 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
Our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions, purchases of additional noncontrolling interests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs, purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock.  Working capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables.  Historically, sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy-in opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements to be higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year.
 
We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt placements.  Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services, and access to products and services from our suppliers.
 
Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.  Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory.  We anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements.
 
We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.  Funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may change.  Consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements.
 
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $684.7 million for the year ended December 29, 2018, compared to $545.5 million for the prior year.  The net change of $139.2 million was primarily attributable to working capital requirements.
  
Net cash used in investing activities was $193.0 million for the year ended December 29, 2018, compared to $342.3 million for the prior year.  The net change of $149.3 million was primarily due to reduced payments for equity investments and business acquisitions, partially offset by reduced proceeds of sales of equity investments.
 
Net cash used in financing activities was $603.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2018, compared to $112.6 million for the prior year.  The net change of $491.2 million was primarily due to increased acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and reduced net borrowings from debt, partially offset by decreased repurchases of common stock. 
 
The following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources (in thousands):
  



 







 


 
Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity.
 
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns
 
Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from operations increased to 43.6 days as of December 29, 2018 from 42.7 days as of December 30, 2017.  During the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, we wrote off approximately $7.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve.   Our inventory turns from operations were 4.9 as of December 29, 2018 and 5.3 as of December 30, 2017.  Our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions.
 
Contractual obligations
 
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate long-term debt, including interest (assuming a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%), as well as inventory purchase commitments and operating and capital lease obligations as of December 29, 2018:  
  



 
Bank Credit Lines
 
On April 18, 2017, we entered into a new $750 million revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”).  This facility, which matures in April 2022, replaced our $500 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in September 2019.   The interest rate is based on the USD LIBOR plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.  On June 29, 2018, we amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) permit the consummation of the Animal Health Spin-off (See Note 21), (ii) provide for swing-line commitments in the amount of $75 million, and (iii) provide for the designation of subsidiary borrowers under the facility.  The Credit Agreement provides, among other things, that we are required to maintain maximum leverage ratios, and contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, indebtedness, significant corporate changes (including mergers), dispositions and certain restrictive agreements.   
 
As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, the borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility and the prior credit facility were $175.0 million and $320.0 million, respectively.  As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, there were $11.2 million and $11.3 million of letters of credit, respectively, provided to third parties under this credit facility.
 
As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, we had various other short-term bank credit lines available, of which $376.5 million and $421.7 million, respectively, were outstanding.  At December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, borrowings under all of our credit lines had a weighted average interest rate of 3.30% and 2.27%, respectively.
 







 


 
Committed Loan Associated with Animal Health Spin-off
 
On May 21, 2018, we obtained a $400 million committed loan which matured on the earlier of (i) March 31, 2019 and (ii) the consummation of the Animal Health Spin-off.  The proceeds of this loan were used, among other things, to fund our purchase of all of the equity interests in Butler Animal Health Holding Company, LLC (“BAHHC”) directly or indirectly owned by Darby Group Companies, Inc. (“Darby”) and certain other sellers pursuant to the terms of that certain Amendment to Put Rights Agreements, dated as of April 20, 2018, by and among us, Darby, BAHHC and the individual sellers party thereto for an aggregate purchase price of $365 million. As of December 29, 2018, the balance outstanding on this loan was $400 million and is included within the “Bank credit lines” caption within our consolidated balance sheet.  At December 29, 2018, the interest rate on this loan was 3.38%.  Concurrent with the completion of the Animal Health Spin-off on February 7, 2019, we re-paid the balance of this loan.  
 
Private Placement Facilities
 
On September 15, 2017, we increased our available private placement facilities with three insurance companies to a total facility amount of $1 billion, and extended the expiration date to September 15, 2020.  These facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance, from time to time through September 15, 2020.  The facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance.  The term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years (with an average life no longer than 12 years). The proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, to refinance existing indebtedness and/or to fund potential acquisitions.  On June 29, 2018, we amended and restated the above private placement facilities to, among other things, (i) permit the consummation of the Animal Health Spin-off and (ii) provide for the issuance of notes in Euros, British Pounds and Australian Dollars, in addition to U.S. Dollars.  The agreements provide, among other things, that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios, and contain restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership.  These facilities contain make-whole provisions in the event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates.
 
The components of our private placement facility borrowings as of December 29, 2018 are presented in the following table (in thousands):
  



 







 


 
U.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization
 
We have a facility agreement with a bank, as agent, based on the securitization of our U.S. trade accounts receivable that is structured as an asset-backed securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years.  On June 1, 2016, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to April 29, 2019 and increased the purchase limit under the facility from $300 million to $350 million.  On July 6, 2017, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to April 29, 2020.  The borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were $350.0 million and $350.0 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.  At December 29, 2018, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 2.66% plus 0.75%, for a combined rate of 3.41%.  At December 30, 2017, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 1.53% plus 0.75%, for a combined rate of 2.28%.
 
We are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is greater than or equal to 50% of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is less than 50% of the facility limit.
 
Borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of Long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet.
 
Long-term debt
 
Long-term debt consisted of the following:
  



 
Stock repurchases
 
From June 21, 2004 through December 29, 2018, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion, or 58,189,377 shares, under our common stock repurchase programs, with $400.0 million available as of December 29, 2018 for future common stock share repurchases.
 







 


 
Noncontrolling interests
 
Some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.  ASC Topic 480-10 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements.  The components of the change in the Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are presented in the following table:
  



 
Changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.
 
Additionally, some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met.  Any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income.
 
During 2018, we entered into a joint venture with Internet Brands to create a newly formed entity, Henry Schein One, LLC.  The joint venture includes Henry Schein Practice Solutions products and services, as well as Henry Schein’s international dental practice management systems and the dental businesses of Internet Brands.   Internet Brands holds a 26% noncontrolling interest in Henry Schein One, LLC that is accounted for within stockholders’ equity, as well as a freestanding and separately exercisable right to put its noncontrolling interest to Henry Schein, Inc. for fair value following the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture.  Beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture, Henry Schein One will issue a fixed number of additional interests to Internet Brands through the fifth anniversary, thereby increasing Internet Brands’ ownership by approximately 7.6%.  Internet Brands will also be entitled to receive a fixed number of additional interests, in the aggregate up to approximately 1.6% of the joint venture’s ownership, if certain operating targets are met by the joint venture in its fourth, fifth and sixth operating years.  These additional shares are considered contingent consideration that are accounted for within stockholders’ equity; however, these shares will not be allocated any net income of Henry Schein One until the shares vest or are earned by Internet Brands.  As a result of this transaction with Internet Brands, we recorded $567.6 million of noncontrolling interest within stockholders’ equity reflecting certain fair value methodology.    
 
Unrecognized tax benefits   
 
As more fully disclosed in Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, of $100.0 million as of December 29, 2018. 
 







 


 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base our estimates on historical data, when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  However, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties.  Reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions, judgments and estimates, including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied.
 
We believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:
 
Revenue Recognition
 
On December 31, 2017, we adopted ASC 606 (“Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 30, 2017 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Our revenue recognition accounting policies applied prior to adoption of Topic 606 are outlined in the financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2017. The disclosures included herein reflect our accounting policies under Topic 606.
 
We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical, and prior to the completion of the Animal Health Spin-off, animal health consumable products, as well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra revenue adjustments are included in the transaction price at contract inception by estimating the most likely amount based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.
 
Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating control has transferred to the customer because we have no post-shipment obligations and this is when legal title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the point at which we have an enforceable right to payment.  
 
Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control transfers to the customer. This occurs when the equipment is delivered.  Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is typically completed at the time of delivery. Our product generally carries standard warranty terms provided by the manufacturer, however, in instances where we provide warranty labor services, the warranty costs are accrued in accordance with ASC 460 “Guarantees”. 
 
Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers or made available electronically. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software, including annual support and/or training, is generally recognized over time using time elapsed as the input method that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.  
 
Revenue derived from other sources, including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided.  We apply the practical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after the customer obtains control as fulfillment activities, rather than a separate performance obligation in the contract.
 







 


 
Sales, value-add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
 
Certain of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include multiple distinct performance obligations which are accounted for separately.  When we sell software products together with related services (i.e., training and technical support), we allocate revenue to software using the residual method, using an estimate of the standalone selling price to estimate the fair value of the undelivered elements.  There are no cases where revenue is deferred due to a lack of a standalone selling price. Bundled arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service.  We allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the goods or services. If an observable selling price is not available (i.e., we do not sell the goods or services separately), we use one of the following techniques to estimate the standalone selling price:  adjusted market approach; cost-plus approach; or the residual method.  There is no specific hierarchy for the use of these methods, but the estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer location and other market conditions.  
 
Accounts Receivable
 
The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability.
 
Contract Assets
 
Contract assets include amounts related to any conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed as of the reporting date and generally represent amounts owed to us by customers, but not yet billed. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when the right becomes unconditional.  Current contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other and the non-current contract assets are included in Investments and other within our consolidated balance sheet.
 
Contract Liabilities
 
Contract liabilities are comprised of advance payments and deferred revenue amounts. Contract liabilities are transferred to revenue once the performance obligation has been satisfied.  Current contract liabilities are included in Accrued expenses: Other and the non-current contract liabilities are included in Other liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet.
 
Deferred Commissions
 
Sales commissions earned by our sales force that relate to long term arrangements are capitalized as costs to obtain a contract when the costs incurred are incremental and are expected to be recovered. Deferred sales commissions are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period.  We apply the practical expedient related to the capitalization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract, and recognize such costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that we would have recognized is one year or less.
 
Sales Returns
 
Sales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount of expected returns and are recorded as refund liability within current liabilities. We estimate the amount of revenue expected to be reversed to calculate the sales return liability based on historical data for specific products, adjusted as necessary for new products.  The allowance for returns is presented gross as a refund liability and we record an inventory asset (and a corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) for any goods or services that we expect to be returned.   







 


 
Inventories and Reserves
 
Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment.  In accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.
 
From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
 
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
 
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually.  Such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.  We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: health care distribution (global dental, medical, and prior to the completion of the Animal Health Spin-off, animal health) and technology and value-added services.  Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis.
 
For the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016 we tested goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis consisting of a two-step approach.  The first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units, including goodwill, to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology.  If step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit, we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss, if any, that we would record for such reporting unit.  The calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill.  
 
Our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates.  We also develop estimates for future levels of gross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures.  Our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors. The estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections.
 
Our impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets.  This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment.  For indefinite-lived intangible assets, a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows, is utilized.  We assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually (at the beginning of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
 
Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:
 
•          significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
 
•          significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g., decision to divest a business); or
 
•          significant negative industry or economic trends.
 
If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income.







 


 
For the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the results of our goodwill and intangible impairment analysis did not result in any impairments.
 
Supplier Rebates
 
Supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned.  The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
 
Long-Lived Assets
 
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets.
 
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property.  For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.  We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value.  When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results.
 
Stock-Based Compensation   
 
Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee directors.  We measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Our stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.
 
Stock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors under the terms of our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and our 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Plans”).  The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Prior to March 2009, awards under the Plans principally included a combination of at-the-money stock options and restricted stock/units.  Since March 2009, equity-based awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock/units, with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain pre-existing contractual obligations.
 
Grants of restricted stock/units are stock-based awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions.  In the case of restricted stock, common stock is delivered on the date of grant, subject to vesting conditions.  In the case of restricted stock units, common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions.  We issue restricted stock/units that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time (primarily four-year cliff vesting, except for grants made under the 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, which are primarily 12-month cliff vesting) and restricted stock/units that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time (primarily three-year cliff vesting).
 
With respect to time-based restricted stock/units, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price.  With respect to performance-based restricted stock/units, the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a 







 



 
specified period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock/units based on our closing stock price at time of grant.
 
The Plans provide for adjustments to the performance-based restricted stock/units targets for significant events, including, without limitation, acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures, certain capital transactions (including share repurchases), restructuring costs, if any, changes in accounting principles or in applicable laws or regulations, foreign exchange fluctuations, certain litigation related costs, and material changes in income tax rates.  Over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets.  The ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the Plans.
 
Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to stock-based compensation are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
 
Accounting Standards Update
 
For a discussion of accounting standards updates that have been adopted or will be adopted in the future, please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.
 
ITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
We are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other, and changes to the credit markets.  We attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.  These hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.  Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets.  All foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure.  We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital.
 
Foreign Currency Agreements
 
The value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar and the value of certain underlying functional currencies of the Company, including its foreign subsidiaries, may affect our financial results.   Fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.  Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings.  We purchase short-term (i.e., 18 months or less) foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers.  We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic exposure.  A hypothetical 5% change in the average value of the U.S. dollar in 2018 compared to foreign currencies would have changed our 2018 reported Net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. by approximately $8.0 million.
 
As of December 29, 2018, we had forward foreign currency exchange agreements, which expire through November 27, 2019, which include a fair value gain of $1.4 million as determined by quoted market prices.  As of December 29, 2018, Henry Schein, Inc. had Euro to Brazilian Real (BRL) cross currency swap contracts notionally totaling an amount of €94.6 million, with a reported fair value of these contracts as a net asset of $9.4 million.  A 5% hypothetical change in the value of the Euro to the BRL from December 29, 2018, with all other variables held constant, would have had changed the value fair value of these swap contracts by approximately $5.3 million. 







 
 


 
Short-Term Investments
 
We limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivative instruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counter-parties to such financial instruments.  As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counter-parties.
 
Variable Interest Rate Debt
 
As of December 29, 2018, we had variable interest rate exposure for certain of our revolving credit facilities and our U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization.
 
Our revolving credit facility which we entered into on April 18, 2017 and expires on April 18, 2022, has an interest rate that is based on the U.S. Dollar LIBOR plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.  As of December 29, 2018, there was $175.0 million outstanding under this revolving credit facility.  During the year ended December 29, 2018, the average outstanding balance under this revolving credit facility was approximately $393.8 million.  Based upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving credit facility, for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points, our interest expense thereunder would have increased by $1.0 million.
 
Our U.S trade accounts receivable securitization, which we entered into on April 17, 2013 and which expires on April 29, 2020, has an interest rate that is based upon the asset-backed commercial paper rate.  As of December 29, 2018, the commercial paper rate was 2.66% plus 0.75%, for a combined rate of 3.41%. At December 29, 2018 the outstanding balance was $350.0 million under this securitization facility.  During the year ended December 29, 2018, the average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately $349.0 million.  Based upon our average outstanding balance for this securitization facility, for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points, our interest expense thereunder would have increased by $0.9 million.

Stockholders and Board of Directors 
Henry Schein, Inc. 
Melville, NY 
 
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. (the “Company”) and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2018, and the related notes and schedule presented in Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and subsidiaries at December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2018,  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated February 20, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
 
Basis for Opinion
 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note 1 –Significant Accounting Policies  
 
Nature of Operations
 
We distribute health care products and services primarily to office-based health care practitioners with operations or affiliates in the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry Schein, Inc. and all of our controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are greater than or equal to 20% and less than or equal to 50% owned or investments in unconsolidated affiliates of less than 20% in which we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method.  See Note 6 for accounting treatment of Redeemable noncontrolling interests.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
 
We consolidate a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) where we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The VIE is a trade accounts receivable securitization. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the majority of the losses or benefits. The results of operations and financial position of this VIE are included in our consolidated financial statements.  
 
For the consolidated VIE, the trade accounts receivable transferred to the VIE are pledged as collateral to the related debt.  The creditors have recourse to us for losses on these trade accounts receivable. For the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, trade accounts receivable that can only be used to settle obligations of this VIE were $422 million and $422 million, respectively, and the liabilities of the VIE where the creditors have recourse to us were $350 million and $350 million, respectively.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Fiscal Year
 
We report our results of operations and cash flows on a 52‑53 week basis ending on the last Saturday of December.  The years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 consisted of 52 weeks, and the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks.
 
Stock Split
 
On August 16, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of our common stock.  Each Henry Schein, Inc. stockholder of record at the close of business on September 1, 2017 received a distribution of one additional share for every share held. Trading began on a split-adjusted basis on September 15, 2017.

Revenue Recognition  
 
On December 31, 2017, we adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 30, 2017 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Our revenue recognition accounting policies applied prior to adoption of Topic 606 are outlined in the financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2017.  The disclosures included herein reflect our accounting policies under Topic 606.
 
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive for those goods or services. To recognize revenue, we do the following:
·          identify the contract(s) with a customer; 
·          identify the performance obligations in the contract; 
·          determine the transaction price; 
·          allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 
·          recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
We generate revenue from the sale of dental, animal health and medical consumable products, equipment (Healthcare distribution revenues), software products and services and other sources (Technology and value-added services revenues). Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra revenue adjustments are included in the transaction price at contract inception by estimating the most likely amount based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.
 
 
Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating control has transferred to the customer because we have no post-shipment obligations and this is when legal title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the point at which we have an enforceable right to payment.  
 
Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control transfers to the customer. This occurs when the equipment is delivered.  Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is typically completed at the time of delivery. Our product generally carries standard warranty terms provided by the manufacturer, however, in instances where we provide warranty labor services, the warranty costs are accrued in accordance with ASC 460 “Guarantees”. 
 
Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers or made available electronically. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software, including annual support and/or training, is generally recognized over time using time elapsed as the input method that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.  
 
Revenue derived from other sources, including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided.  We apply the practical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after the customer obtains control as fulfillment activities, rather than a separate performance obligation in the contract.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) 
(in thousands, except per share data) 
 


 
Sales, value-add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
 
Certain of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include multiple distinct performance obligations which are accounted for separately.  When we sell software products together with related services (i.e., training and technical support), we allocate revenue to software using the residual method, using an estimate of the standalone selling price to estimate the fair value of the undelivered elements.  There are no cases where revenue is deferred due to a lack of a standalone selling price. Bundled arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service.  We allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the goods or services. If an observable selling price is not available (i.e., we do not sell the goods or services separately), we use one of the following techniques to estimate the standalone selling price:  adjusted market approach; cost-plus approach; or the residual method.  There is no specific hierarchy for the use of these methods, but the estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer location and other market conditions
 
See Note 15 for additional disclosures of disaggregated net sales and Note 16 for disclosures of net sales by segment and geographic data.  
 
Contract Balances
 
Contract balances represent amounts presented in our consolidated balance sheet when either we have transferred goods or services to the customer or the customer has paid consideration to us under the contract. These contract balances include accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable are generally recognized when heath care distribution and technology and value-added services revenues are recognized. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability.
 
Contract Assets
 
Contract assets include amounts related to any conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed as of the reporting date and generally represent amounts owed to us by customers, but not yet billed. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when the right becomes unconditional.  The contract assets primarily relate to our bundled arrangements for the sale of equipment and consumables and sales of term software licenses. Current contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other and the non-current contract assets are included in Investments and other within our consolidated balance sheet.  Current and non-current contract asset balances as of December 29, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were not material.
 
Contract Liabilities
 
Contract liabilities are comprised of advance payments and upfront payments for service arrangements provided over time that are accounted for as deferred revenue amounts. Contract liabilities are transferred to revenue once the performance obligation has been satisfied.  Current contract liabilities are included in Accrued expenses: Other and the non-current contract liabilities are included in Other liabilities within our consolidated 







HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

balance sheet.  At December 31, 2017, the current portion of contract liabilities of $85.7 million was reported in Accrued expenses: Other, and $5.2 million related to non-current contract liabilities were reported in Other liabilities.  During the year ended December 29, 2018, we recognized substantially all of the current contract liability amounts that were previously deferred at December 31, 2017.  At December 29, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $83.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively.
 
Deferred Commissions
 
Sales commissions earned by our sales force that relate to long term arrangements are capitalized as costs to obtain a contract when the costs incurred are incremental and are expected to be recovered. Deferred sales commissions are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period.  We apply the practical expedient related to the capitalization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract, and recognize such costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that we would have recognized is one year or less.
 
Sales Returns
 
Sales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount of expected returns and are recorded as refund liability within current liabilities. We estimate the amount of revenue expected to be reversed to calculate the sales return liability based on historical data for specific products, adjusted as necessary for new products.  The allowance for returns is presented gross as a refund liability and we record an inventory asset (and a corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) for any goods or services that we expect to be returned.  
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents  
 
We consider all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Due to the short-term maturity of such investments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.  Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit of $72.0 million and $83.6 million, primarily related to payments for inventory, were classified as accounts payable as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.  
 
Inventories and Reserves  
 
Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment.  In accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.  From time to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory.
 
Direct Shipping and Handling Costs
 
Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales.  Direct handling costs, which represent primarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Direct shipping and handling costs were $102.1 million, $93.3 million and $84.0 million for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. 
 








HENRY SCHEIN, INC.  
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) 
(in thousands, except per share data) 
 


 
Advertising and Promotional Costs
 
We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred.  Total advertising and promotional expenses were $28.9 million, $15.7 million and $18.4 million for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
 
Supplier Rebates
 
Supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned.  The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales, in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.
 
Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.  Depreciation is computed primarily under the straight-line method (see Note 2 - Property and Equipment, Net for estimated useful lives).  Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the lease term.
 
Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software.  Costs incurred during the application development stage for software bought and further customized by outside suppliers for our use and software developed by a supplier for our proprietary use are capitalized.  Costs incurred for our own personnel who are directly associated with software development are capitalized.
 
Income Taxes
 
We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.  In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates.  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  Our accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, is further discussed in Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”  We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries.
 
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
 
The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.  Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end.  Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year.  Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.
 
Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments
 
We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our objective is to manage the impact that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have on recognized asset and liability fair values, earnings and cash flows.  Our risk management policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged and be 







HENRY SCHEIN, INC.  
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) 
(in thousands, except per share data) 
 



 
designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.  We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.  Our derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements related to certain intercompany loans and certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with foreign suppliers. 
 
Our foreign currency forward agreements related to forecasted inventory purchase commitments are designated as cash flow hedges.  For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  We classify the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category on our consolidated statements of cash flows as the cash flows related to the hedged item.
 
Our foreign currency forward agreements related to foreign currency balance sheet exposure provide economic hedges but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
 
For agreements not designated as hedges, changes in the value of the derivative, along with the transaction gain or loss on the hedged item, are recorded in earnings.
 
Acquisitions
 
The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date.  Any excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  The major classes of assets and liabilities that we generally allocate purchase price to, excluding goodwill, include identifiable intangible assets (i.e., trademarks and trade names, customer relationships and lists and non-compete agreements), property, plant and equipment, deferred taxes and other current and long-term assets and liabilities.  The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on critical estimates, judgments and assumptions derived from: analysis of market conditions; discount rates; discounted cash flows; customer retention rates; and estimated useful lives.  Some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met.  For the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were no material adjustments recorded in our consolidated statement of income relating to changes in estimated contingent purchase price liabilities.  
 
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
 
Some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.  Their interests in these subsidiaries are classified outside permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets and are carried at the estimated redemption amounts.  The redemption amounts have been estimated based on expected future earnings and cash flow and, if such earnings and cash flow are not achieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests might be impacted.  Changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are reflected at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.
 
Noncontrolling Interests
 
Noncontrolling interests represent our less than 50% ownership interest in an acquired subsidiary.  Our net income is reduced by the portion of the subsidiaries net income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
 
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually.  Such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.  We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: health care distribution (global dental, animal health and medical) and technology and value-added services.  Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis.
 
For the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016 we tested goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis consisting of a two-step approach.  The first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units, including goodwill, to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology.  If step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit, we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss, if any, that we would record for such reporting unit.  The calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill.  
 
Our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates.  We also develop estimates for future levels of gross profits and operating profits and projected capital expenditures.  Our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors. The estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections.
 
Our impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets.  This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment.  For indefinite-lived intangible assets, a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows, is utilized.  We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually (at the beginning of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
 
Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:
 
•          significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
 
•          significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g., decision to divest a business); or
 
•          significant negative industry or economic trends.
 
If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income.
 
For the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the results of our goodwill and intangible impairment analysis did not result in any impairments.

Long-Lived Assets
 
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets.
 
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property.  For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.  We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value.  When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.
 
Cost of Sales 
 
The primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product (net of purchase discounts, supplier chargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges.  Costs related to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other costs of our distribution network are included in selling, general and administrative expenses along with other operating costs.
 
As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  Total distribution network costs were $87.3 million, $83.2 million and $79.4 million for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
 
Comprehensive Income
 
Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity.  Our comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income, foreign currency translation gain (loss), unrealized gain (loss) from foreign currency hedging activities, unrealized investment gain (loss) and pension adjustment gain (loss).
 
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted
 
InMay 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 (“Topic 606”).  We adopted the provisions of this standard as of December 31, 2017, on a modified retrospective basis.  We applied the requirements of the new standard only to contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. We recorded an immaterial adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the adoption of Topic 606. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. 
 
The impact of the new standard on our consolidated statements of income, which we expect to be immaterial on an ongoing basis, is primarily related to software sales and sales commissions and is described as follows:
 
Software Sales
 
For software licenses sold together with post contract support (PCS), we previously deferred software revenue if it did not have vendor-specific evidence of fair value of the PCS.  Under Topic 606, the concept of

(in thousands, except per share data) 
 



 
vendor-specific objective evidence is eliminated and there are no cases where revenue is deferred due to a lack of standalone selling price.  In addition, we previously recognized revenue from term licenses ratably over the contract term.  Under Topic 606, such licenses represent a right to use intellectual property and therefore require upfront recognition.  Furthermore, certain upfront fees related to service arrangements were previously deferred and recognized over the estimated customer life.  Under Topic 606, the period over which we will recognize these fees is reduced, as the upfront fee represents additional contract price which will be allocated to the performance obligations in the contract and recognized as those performance obligations are satisfied, rather than being amortized over the estimated customer life. Based on the aforementioned changes, such software revenue will be recognized sooner than under the previous revenue recognition standard.
 
Sales Commissions  
 
We previously recognized sales commissions as an expense when incurred.  Under Topic 606, we defer such sales commissions as costs to obtain a contract when the costs are incremental and expected to be recovered.  Deferred sales commissions are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period.  We apply the practical expedient to expense, as incurred, commissions with an expected amortization period of one year or less.  
 
The impact of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet and income statement was as follows:

Additional information related to Topic 606 can be found below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” as well as in Note 15.
 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, “Income Taxes, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory” (“Topic 740”).  Topic 740 requires companies to recognize the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets other than inventory in the period which the transfer occurs.  Previously, companies were required to defer the income tax effects on intercompany transfer of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party. On December 31, 2017, we adopted the guidance, which is effective for annual periods and related interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 on a modified retrospective basis.  As a result of the adoption of Topic 740, we have recorded an immaterial adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and a reduction to prepaid assets. 
 
The cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 related to Topic 606 and Topic 740 were as follows:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  Consistent with current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.  However, unlike current U.S. GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.  The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements” which permits adoption of the guidance in ASU 2016-02 using either a modified retrospective transition, requiring application at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or a transition method whereby companies could continue to apply existing lease guidance during the comparative periods and apply the new lease requirements through a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption rather than in the earliest period presented without adjusting historical financial statements.  
 
We will use the modified retrospective transition approach in ASU No. 2018-11 and apply the new lease requirements through a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption.  We are currently finalizing the effects that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, but anticipate that the new guidance will significantly impact our consolidated balance sheet as we will recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for our operating leases.  The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We expect to elect the package of practical expedients, which permits us not to reassess, under the new standard, our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We do not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us.  We do not expect that this accounting standard will have a material impact on our debt covenants.  We also do not expect that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our results of operations.  We are implementing a new lease accounting system and updating our processes in preparation for the adoption of the new standard.
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost.  This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  This ASU is required to be adopted using the modified retrospective basis, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance of this ASU is effective.  Based upon the level and makeup of our financial asset portfolio, past receivables loss activity and current known activity regarding our outstanding receivables, we do not expect that this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other” (Topic 350) (“ASU 2017-04”).  ASU 2017-04 eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test, thereby eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of a reporting unit.  ASU 2017-04 will require us to perform our annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of those units.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we will be required to recognize an impairment charge; however, the impairment charge should not exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit.  ASU 2017-04 is required to be implemented on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  We do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2017-04 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging” (Topic 815) (“ASU 2017-12”), which simplifies the requirements for hedge accounting, more closely aligns hedge accounting with risk management activities and increases transparency of the scope and results of hedging activities. This ASU amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how we can assess the effectiveness of our hedging

relationships.  This ASU will make more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting.  ASU 2017-12 is required to be implemented for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  We do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2017-12 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
 
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, "Treatment of Stranded Tax Effects in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Resulting From the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 " which allows the reclassification from accumulated comprehensive income to retained earnings the income tax effects resulting from the Tax Act.  This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  We do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2018-02 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2018-07”), which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees.  ASU 2018-07 simplifies the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees.  ASU 2018-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year.  We do not expect that the requirements of ASU-2018-07 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract” (“ASU 2018-15”), which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).  The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this ASU.  ASU 2018-15 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We do not expect that the requirements of this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Other intangible assets consisted of the following:
  



 
Non-compete agreements represent amounts paid primarily to key employees and prior owners of acquired businesses, as well as certain sales persons, in exchange for placing restrictions on their ability to pose a competitive risk to us.  Such amounts are amortized, on a straight-line basis over the respective non-compete period, which generally commences upon termination of employment or separation from us.  The weighted-average non-compete period for agreements currently being amortized was approximately 5.2 years as of December 29, 2018.
 
Trademarks, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships were established through business acquisitions.  Definite-lived trademarks and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 8.2 years as of December 29, 2018.  Customer relationships and customer lists are definite-lived intangible assets that are amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 10.8 years as of December 29, 2018.  Product development is a definite-lived intangible asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 10.1 years as of December 29, 2018.  
 
Amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $123.3 million, $116.5 million and $98.2 million.  The annual

Note 5 – Debt
 
Bank Credit Lines
 
On April 18, 2017, we entered into a new $750 million revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”).  This facility, which matures in April 2022, replaced our $500 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in September 2019.   The interest rate is based on the USD LIBOR plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.  On June 29, 2018, we amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) permit the consummation of the Animal Health Spin-off (See Note 21), (ii) provide for swing-line commitments in the amount of $75 million, and (iii) provide for the designation of subsidiary borrowers under the facility.  The Credit Agreement provides, among other things, that we are required to maintain maximum leverage ratios, and contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, indebtedness, significant corporate changes (including mergers), dispositions and certain restrictive agreements.  
 
As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, the borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility were $175.0 million and $320.0 million, respectively.  As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, there were $11.2 million and $11.3 million of letters of credit, respectively, provided to third parties under this credit facility.  
 
As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, we had various other short-term bank credit lines available, of which $376.5 million and $421.7 million, respectively, were outstanding.  At December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, borrowings under all of our credit lines had a weighted average interest rate of 3.30% and 2.27%, respectively.

Committed Loan Associated with Animal Health Spin-off
 
On May 21, 2018, we obtained a $400 million committed loan which matured on the earlier of (i) March 31, 2019 and (ii) the consummation of the Animal Health Spin-off.  The proceeds of this loan were used, among other things, to fund our purchase of all of the equity interests in Butler Animal Health Holding Company, LLC (“BAHHC”) directly or indirectly owned by Darby Group Companies, Inc. (“Darby”) and certain other sellers pursuant to the terms of that certain Amendment to Put Rights Agreements, dated as of April 20, 2018, by and among us, Darby, BAHHC and the individual sellers party thereto for an aggregate purchase price of $365 million. As of December 29, 2018, the balance outstanding on this loan was $400 million and is included within the “Bank credit lines” caption within our consolidated balance sheet.  At December 29, 2018, the interest rate on this loan was 3.38%.  Concurrent with the completion of the Animal Health Spin-off on February 7, 2019, we re-paid the balance of this loan.

Long-term debt consisted of the following:
  



 
Private Placement Facilities
 
On September 15, 2017, we increased our available private placement facilities with three insurance companies to a total facility amount of $1 billion, and extended the expiration date to September 15, 2020.  These facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance, from time to time through September 15, 2020.  The facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance.  The term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years (with an average life no longer than 12 years). The proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, to refinance existing indebtedness and/or to fund potential acquisitions.  On June 29, 2018, we amended and restated the above private placement facilities to, among other things, (i) permit the consummation of the Animal Health Spin-off and (ii) provide for the issuance of notes in Euros, British Pounds and Australian Dollars, in addition to U.S. Dollars.  The agreements provide, among other things, that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios, and contain restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership.  These facilities contain make-whole provisions in the event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates.

U.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization
 
We have a facility agreement with a bank, as agent, based on the securitization of our U.S. trade accounts receivable that is structured as an asset-backed securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years.  On June 1, 2016, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to April 29, 2019 and increased the purchase limit under the facility from $300 million to $350 million.  On July 6, 2017, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to April 29, 2020.  The borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were $350.0 million and $350.0 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively.  At December 29, 2018, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 2.66% plus 0.75%, for a combined rate of 3.41%.  At December 30, 2017, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 1.53% plus 0.75%, for a combined rate of 2.28%.
 
We are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is greater than or equal to 50% of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is less than 50% of the facility limit.
 
Borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of Long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet.

Note 6 – Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
 
Some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.   ASC 480-10 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements.  The components of the change in the Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are presented in the following table:
  



 
Changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.

Note 8 – Fair Value Measurements
 
ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC Topic 820”) provides a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles.
 
ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
 
The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described as follows:
 
•     Level 1— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.
 
•     Level 2— Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active

markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
 
•     Level 3— Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.
 
The following section describes the fair values of our financial instruments and the methodologies that we used to measure their fair values. 
 
Investments and notes receivable
 
There are no quoted market prices available for investments in unconsolidated affiliates and notes receivable; however, we believe the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.
 
Debt
 
The fair value of our debt (including bank credit lines) as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 was estimated at $1,964.3 million and $1,666.1 million, respectively.  Factors that we considered when estimating the fair value of our debt include market conditions, such as interest rates and credit spreads.
 
Derivative contracts
 
Derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and significant other observable and unobservable inputs.  We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements related to intercompany loans and certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with suppliers.
 
The fair values for the majority of our foreign currency derivative contracts are obtained by comparing our contract rate to a published forward price of the underlying market rates, which is based on market rates for comparable transactions and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
 
Redeemable noncontrolling interests
 
Some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on third-party valuations.  The primary factor affecting the future value of redeemable noncontrolling interests is expected earnings and, if such earnings are not achieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests might be impacted.  The noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted to their estimated redemption amounts each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.  The values for Redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The details of the changes in Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented in Note 6.

Note 9 – Business Acquisitions
 
 
The operating results of all acquisitions are reflected in our financial statements from their respective acquisition dates.
 
On July 1, 2018, we closed on a joint venture with Internet Brands, a provider of web presence and online marketing software, to create a newly formed entity, Henry Schein One, LLC.  The joint venture includes Henry Schein Practice Solutions products and services, as well as Henry Schein’s international dental practice management systems and the dental businesses of Internet Brands.  We own 74% of the joint venture and Internet Brands owns the remaining 26% noncontrolling interest, which is accounted for within stockholders’ equity.   In addition, Internet Brands received a freestanding and separately exercisable right to put their noncontrolling interest to Henry Schein, Inc. for fair value following the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture.  Beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture, Henry Schein One will issue a fixed number of additional interests to Internet Brands through the fifth anniversary of the effective date, thereby increasing Internet Brands’ ownership by approximately 7.6%.  Internet Brands will also be entitled to receive a fixed number of additional interests, in the aggregate up to approximately 1.6% of the joint venture’s ownership, if certain operating targets are met by the joint venture in its fourth, fifth and sixth operating years.  These additional shares are considered contingent consideration that are accounted for within stockholders’ equity; however these shares will not be allocated any net income of Henry Schein One until the shares vest or are earned by Internet Brands.  As a result of the transaction with Internet Brands, we recorded $567.6 million of noncontrolling interest within stockholders’ equity reflecting certain fair value methodology.

Senior management from Henry Schein and Internet Brands serve on the board of Henry Schein One.  The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition primarily reflects the value of future synergies.  We allocated all of the goodwill to our Technology and value-added services reporting segment.  As of December 29, 2018, the goodwill associated with this transaction is $551.7 million.  None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes, and as such, no deferred taxes have been recorded related to goodwill.
 
Concurrent with the formation of Henry Schein One, LLC, we entered into a separate agreement with Internet Brands whereby (1) beginning July 1, 2023, Internet Brands will have the right to require Henry Schein to purchase all or a portion of Internet Brands ownership interests in Henry Schein One, LLC for fair market value, and (2) beginning July 1, 2028, or earlier if certain events occur, Henry Schein will have the right to require Internet Brands to sell all or a portion of its ownership interests in Henry Schein One, LLC to Henry Schein for fair market value.
 
We completed certain other acquisitions during the year ended December 29, 2018, which were immaterial to our financial statements individually and in the aggregate.  As of December 29, 2018, we recorded approximately $15.2 million of goodwill through preliminary purchase price allocations for these acquisitions.  Total acquisition transaction costs incurred in the year ended December 29, 2018 were immaterial to our financial results.

Note 10 – Plans of Restructuring 
 
On July 9, 2018, we committed to an initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies. These actions will allow us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure and fund new initiatives that are expected to drive future growth under our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan.  This initiative is expected to include the elimination of approximately 2% to 3% of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities.  The total 2018 costs associated with the actions to complete this restructuring were previously expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million, however, additional cost savings opportunities were identified in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting in a charge of $35.4 million, which increased our full year 2018 restructuring charges to $62.9 million, consisting primarily of severance costs. 
 
We plan to continue restructuring activities in the first half of 2019 and expect to incur additional restructuring costs related to these activities during Q1 and Q2 2019.  At this time we are identifying specific opportunities and cannot reasonably estimate the amount of additional restructuring costs in 2019.
 
On November 6, 2014, we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies, which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015.  This initiative originally planned for the elimination of approximately 2% to 3% of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities.  We subsequently announced our plan to extend these restructuring activities through the end of 2016 to further implement cost-savings initiatives, which ultimately resulted in the elimination of approximately 900 positions, representing slightly more than 4% of our workforce.  The total costs associated with the actions for this restructuring included $34.9 million pre-tax, which was recorded in fiscal 2015, and $45.9 million pre-tax, which was recorded in fiscal 2016.  
 
The costs associated with these restructurings are included in a separate line item, “Restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income.
 
The following table shows the amounts expensed and paid for restructuring costs that were incurred during our 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years and the remaining accrued balance of restructuring costs as of December 29, 2018, which is included in Accrued expenses: Other and Other liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet:

Note 11 – Earnings Per Share 
 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Our diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to basic earnings per share, except that it reflects the effect of common shares issuable for presently unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units and upon exercise of stock options, using the treasury stock method in periods in which they have a dilutive effect.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to our deferred income tax asset (liability) were as follows:
  



 
The table above has been revised for presentational purposes to separately present total deferred tax assets and total deferred tax liabilities.
 
The assessment of the amount of value assigned to our deferred tax assets under the applicable accounting rules is judgmental.  We are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating the likelihood that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the future.  Such evidence includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and the results of recent operations.  Since this evaluation requires consideration of events that may occur some years into the future, there is an element of judgment involved.  Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods.  We believe that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to allow us to recover substantially all of the value assigned to our deferred tax assets.  However, if future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover all of the value assigned to our deferred tax assets, we will be required to adjust our valuation allowance accordingly.
 
As of December 29, 2018, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $2.4 million, which can be utilized against future foreign income through December 31, 2026.  Additionally, as of December 29, 2018, there were foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $135.9 million that have an indefinite life.  As of December 29, 2018, the company had post-apportionment state net operating loss carryforwards of $16.9 million, which can be

utilized against future state income through December 31, 2038.  Additionally, as of December 29, 2018, there were post-apportionment state operating loss carryforwards of $12.5 million that have an indefinite life.
  
 
The tax provisions differ from the amount computed using the federal statutory income tax rate as follows:
  



 
For the year ended December 29, 2018, our effective tax rate was 22.4% compared to 44.1% for the prior year period.  In 2018, our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a reduction in the estimate of our transition tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”), tax charges and credits associated with legal entity reorganizations outside the U.S., and state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.  In 2017, our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the Tax Act, the adoption of ASU 2016-09, as well as state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Act.  The Tax Act is comprehensive tax legislation that implemented complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, modification of accelerated depreciation, the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and changes to the limitations of the deductibility of interest.  Additionally, the Tax Act moved from a global tax regime to a modified territorial regime, which requires U.S. companies to pay a mandatory one-time transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S.  The transition tax is payable over eight years.  The Tax Act also included provisions to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), a beneficial tax rate foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”), a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) that imposes tax on certain foreign related-party payments, and IRC Section 163(j) interest limitation (Interest Limitation).  We became subject to the GILTI, FDII, BEAT and Interest Limitation provisions effective January 1, 2018.

The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. We elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.  Under Topic 740, we estimated the impact of each provision of the Tax Act on our effective tax and recorded a current tax expense for the GILTI provision of $7.5 million in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 29, 2018.  For the BEAT, FDII and Interest Limitation computations, we have not recorded an estimate in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 29, 2018 because we have concluded that these provisions of the Tax Act will not apply to us in 2018.
Due to the complexities of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) that allowed the company to record a provisional amount for any income tax effects of the Tax Act in accordance with ASC 740, to the extent that a reasonable estimate can be made, in its 2017 financial statements.  SAB 118 allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts.   In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts for any items that could be reasonably estimated at the time.  This included the one-time transition tax that we estimated to be $140.0 million and a net deferred tax expense of $3.0 million attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the lower enacted federal income tax rate of 21%.  Within our consolidated balance sheets, $27.4 million was included in “Accrued taxes” and $112.6 million was included in “Other liabilities”.  In the aggregate, for the quarter ended December 30, 2017, these Tax Act modifications resulted in a one-time tax expense of approximately $143.0million.  Absent the effects of the transition tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 30, 2017 would have been 26.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 44.1%.  
For the year ended December 29, 2018 we have recorded a net $10.0 million reduction to the one-time transition tax and an additional $1.7 million net deferred tax benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate.  Within our consolidated balance sheets, $9.9 million is included in “Accrued taxes” and $104.2 million is included in “Other liabilities” for the transition tax.  The changes were a result of additional analysis, changes in interpretation and assumptions, as well as additional regulatory guidance that was issued.  As of December 22, 2018, the Company has completed its analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in accordance with SAB 118 and the amounts are now considered final.   
 
During 2016, the effective tax rate was affected by a federal tax audit settlement, which reduced our income tax expense by approximately $4.5 million which is included in the unrecognized tax benefits amount above.  
 
Due to the one-time transition tax and the imposition of the GILTI provisions, all previously unremitted earnings will no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, there could be U.S. state and/or foreign
withholding taxes upon distribution of such unremitted earnings.  Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.
 
ASC Topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with other provisions contained within this guidance.  This topic prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement.  In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities.  Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions taken in respect to certain tax matters.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in “Other liabilities” within our consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2018 was approximately $100.0 million, of which $86.1 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.  It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect the change to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
The total amounts of interest and penalties, which are classified as a component of the provision for income taxes and included in “Other liabilities”, were approximately $16.4 million and $0, respectively, as of December 29, 2018.
 
The tax years subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions include the years 2012 and forward by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), as well as the years 2008 and forward for certain states and certain foreign jurisdictions.  In December 2014, the IRS issued a Statutory Notice of Deficiency for 2009, 2010 and 2011.  During the quarter ended March 28, 2015, we filed our petition to the U.S. Tax Court disputing the adjustments proposed by the IRS.  During the quarter ended June 27, 2015, we were notified by the IRS that our protest was transferred to the Appellate Divisions (Appeals Section) of the IRS.  During the quarter ended March 26, 2016, we filed our protest with the Appellate Division. The opening appeals conference was held on June 8, 2016 and a proposed settlement was reached.  On July 13, 2016, a joint status report was filed with the Tax Court indicating a basis for settlement had been reached on all of the issues in this case.  On October 7, 2016 an executed decision document was signed by the Internal Revenue Service’s Special Trial Attorney and submitted to the Tax Court finalizing the Appeals decision.  Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 we filed a Mutual Agreement Procedure request with the IRS for assistance from the U.S. Competent Authority for an open Transfer Pricing issue which resulted in a partial settlement during the quarter ended December 30, 2017.  We received a 30 Day Letter from the IRS during the quarter ended April 1, 2017 for the remaining open audit issues for the years 2012 and 2013.  We filed a Protest with the Appellate Division regarding these issues during the second quarter of 2017.  We had an initial Appeals Conference during the third quarter of 2018, of which we are awaiting a final settlement.  During the quarter ended December 29, 2018, we submitted the first draft of our proposed Advanced Pricing Agreement covering tax years 2014-2024 to the IRS in which Henry Schein, Inc. and the IRS would agree on an appropriate transfer pricing methodology.  We do not expect this to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or the results of operations.

Note 13 – Concentrations of Risk
 
Certain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk.  These financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables, long-term investments, notes receivable and derivative instruments.  In all cases, our maximum exposure to loss from credit risk equals the gross fair value of the financial instruments.  We continuously assess the need for reserves for such losses, which have been within our expectations.  We do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, except for long-term notes receivable.
 
We limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and derivative instruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counter-parties to such financial instruments.  As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counter-parties.
 
With respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively large customer base and its dispersion across different types of health care professionals and geographic areas.  No single customer accounted for more than 1% of our net sales in 2018 or 2017.  With respect to our sources of supply, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 32% and 6%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2018 and approximately 34% and 5%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2017.
 
Our long-term notes receivable primarily represent strategic financing arrangements with certain industry affiliates and amounts owed to us from sales of certain businesses.  Generally, these notes are secured by certain assets of the counter-party; however, in most cases our security is subordinate to other commercial financial institutions.  While we have exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing assessments of their financial and operational performance.
 
Note 14 –  Derivatives and Hedging Activities
 
We are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other, and changes to credit risk of the derivative counterparties.  We attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.  These hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.  Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets.  All foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure.  We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our counterparties, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital.
 
Fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.  Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings.  We purchase short-term (i.e., 18 months or less) foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to our foreign suppliers.  We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic exposure.  Our hedging activities have historically not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, additional disclosures related to derivatives and hedging activities required by ASC Topic 815 have been omitted.

The following table presents information about our operations by geographic area as of and for the three years ended December 29, 2018.  Net sales by geographic area are based on the respective locations of our subsidiaries.  No country, except for the United States, generated net sales greater than 10% of consolidated net sales.  There were no material amounts of sales or transfers among geographic areas and there were no material amounts of export sales.
  



 
Note 17 – Employee Benefit Plans
 
Stock-based Compensation
 
Our accompanying consolidated statements of income reflect pre-tax share-based compensation expense of $36.2 million ($28.1 million after-tax), $42.3 million ($23.7 million after-tax) and $58.2 million ($41.4 million after-tax) for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. 
 
Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows present our stock-based compensation expense as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for all periods presented.  In the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, there were no benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation as a cash inflow from financing activities for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 and $0.5 million of such benefits for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee directors.  We measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Our stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.
 
Stock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors under the terms of our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and our 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Plans”).  The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Prior to March 2009, awards under the Plans principally included a combination of at-the-money stock options and restricted stock/units.  Since March 2009, equity-based awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock/units, with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain pre-existing contractual obligations.  As of December 29, 2018, there were 62,459 shares authorized and 6,262 shares available to be granted under the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 1,800 shares authorized and 256 shares available to be granted under the 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan.  
 
Grants of restricted stock/units are stock-based awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions.  In the case of restricted stock, common stock is delivered on the date of grant, subject to vesting conditions.  In the case of restricted stock units, common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions.  We issue restricted stock/units that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time (primarily four-year cliff vesting, except for grants made under the 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, which are primarily 12-month cliff vesting) and restricted stock/units that vest based on our

(in thousands, except per share data) 
 



 
achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time (primarily three-year cliff vesting).
 
With respect to time-based restricted stock/units, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price.  With respect to performance-based restricted stock/units, the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a specified period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock/units based on our closing stock price at time of grant.
 
The Plans provide for adjustments to the performance-based restricted stock/units targets for significant events, including, without limitation, acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures, certain capital transactions (including share repurchases), restructuring costs, if any, changes in accounting principles or in applicable laws or regulations and certain foreign exchange fluctuations.  Over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets.  The ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the Plans.
 
We record deferred income tax assets for awards that will result in future deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a deduction.  
 
During the first quarter of 2017, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 which requires that  all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies resulting from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the stock-based compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes be included as a component of income tax expense as of January 1, 2017.  Prior to the implementation of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits were recorded as a component of Additional paid-in capital and tax deficiencies were recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits or in the income statement if there were no accumulated excess tax benefits.
 
Stock-based compensation grants for the three years ended December 29, 2018 primarily consisted of restricted stock/unit grants.  Certain stock-based compensation granted may require us to settle in the form of a cash payment.  During the year ended December 29, 2018, we recorded a liability of $0.8 million relating to the grant date fair value of stock-based compensation to be settled in cash.  The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-based awards granted before forfeitures was $71.38, $85.43 and $83.90 per share during the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.  
 
Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards as of December 29, 2018 was $77.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years.

401(k) Plans
 
We offer qualified 401(k) plans to substantially all our domestic full-time employees.  As determined by our Board of Directors, matching contributions to these plans generally do not exceed 100% of the participants’ contributions up to 7% of their base compensation, subject to applicable legal limits.  Matching contributions consist of cash and were allocated entirely to the participants’ investment elections on file, subject to a 20% allocation limit to the Henry Schein Stock Fund.  Forfeitures attributable to participants whose employment terminates prior to becoming fully vested are used to reduce our matching contributions and offset administrative expenses of the 401(k) plans.
 
Assets of the 401(k) and other defined contribution plans are held in self-directed accounts enabling participants to choose from various investment fund options.  Matching contributions and administrative expenses related to these plans charged to operations during the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 amounted to $35.0 million, $39.0 million and $33.9 million, respectively.
 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
 
We offer an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan to eligible employees.  This plan generally covers officers and certain highly-compensated employees after they have reached the maximum IRS allowed pre-tax 401(k) contribution limit.  Our contributions to this plan are equal to the 401(k) employee-elected contribution percentage applied to base compensation for the portion of the year in which such employees are not eligible to make pre-tax contributions to the 401(k) plan.  The amounts charged (credited) to operations during the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 amounted to $(0.4) million, $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
 
Deferred Compensation Plan
 
During 2011, we began to offer a deferred compensation plan to a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company and certain subsidiaries. This plan allows for the elective deferral of base salary, bonus and/or commission compensation by eligible employees.  The amounts charged to operations during

We also have lifetime consulting agreements that provide for current compensation of $0.5 million per year, increasing $25 every fifth year with the next increase in 2022.  In addition, some agreements have provisions for additional incentives and compensation. 
 
Litigation   
 
Beginning in January 2016, purported class action complaints were filed against Patterson Companies, Inc. (“Patterson”), Benco Dental Supply Co. (“Benco”) and Henry Schein, Inc. Although there were factual and legal variations among these complaints, each of these complaints alleges, among other things, that defendants conspired to fix prices, allocate customers and foreclose competitors by boycotting manufacturers, state dental associations and others that deal with defendants’ competitors.  On February 9, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York ordered all of these actions, and all other actions filed thereafter asserting substantially similar claims against defendants, consolidated for pre-trial purposes.  On February 26, 2016, a consolidated class action complaint was filed by Arnell Prato, D.D.S., P.L.L.C., d/b/a Down to Earth Dental, Evolution Dental Sciences, LLC, Howard M. May, DDS, P.C., Casey Nelson, D.D.S., Jim Peck, D.D.S., Bernard W. Kurek, D.M.D., Larchmont Dental Associates, P.C., and Keith Schwartz, D.M.D., P.A. (collectively, “putative class representatives”) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, entitled In re Dental Supplies Antitrust Litigation, Civil Action No. 1:16-CV-00696-BMC-GRB.  In the consolidated class action complaint, putative class representatives allege a nationwide agreement among Henry Schein, Benco, Patterson and non-party Burkhart Dental Supply Company, Inc. (“Burkhart”) not to compete on price. The consolidated class action complaint asserts a single count under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seeks equitable relief, compensatory and treble damages, jointly and severally, and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees.  On September 28, 2018, the parties executed a settlement agreement that proposes, subject to court approval, a full and final settlement of the lawsuit on a classwide basis.  Subject to certain exceptions, the settlement class consists of all persons or entities that purchased dental products directly from Henry Schein, Patterson, Benco, Burkhart, or any combination thereof, during the period August 31, 2008 through and including March 31, 2016.  As a result, we recorded a charge of $38.5 million in our third quarter 2018 results.   
 
On August 31, 2012, Archer and White Sales, Inc. (“Archer”) filed a complaint against Henry Schein, Inc. as well as Danaher Corporation and its subsidiaries Instrumentarium Dental, Inc., Dental Equipment, LLC, Kavo Dental Technologies, LLC and Dental Imaging Technologies Corporation (collectively, the “Danaher Defendants”)

in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Civil Action No. 2:12-CV-00572-JRG, styled as an antitrust action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and the Texas Free Enterprise Antitrust Act.  Archer alleges a conspiracy between Henry Schein, an unnamed company and the Danaher Defendants to terminate or limit Archer’s distribution rights.  On August 1, 2017, Archer filed an amended complaint, adding Patterson and Benco as defendants, and alleging that Henry Schein, Patterson, Benco and Burkhart conspired to fix prices and refused to compete with each other for sales of dental equipment to dental professionals and agreed to enlist their common suppliers, the Danaher Defendants, to join a price-fixing conspiracy and boycott by reducing the distribution territory of, and eventually terminating, their price-cutting competing distributor Archer.  Archer seeks damages in an amount to be proved at trial, to be trebled with interest and costs, including attorneys’ fees, jointly and severally, as well as injunctive relief.  On October 30, 2017, Archer filed a second amended complaint, to add additional allegations that it believes support its claims.  The named parties and causes of action are the same as the August 1, 2017 amended complaint.  
 
On October 1, 2012, we filed a motion for an order: (i) compelling Archer to arbitrate its claims against us; (2) staying all proceedings pending arbitration; and (3) joining the Danaher Defendants’ motion to arbitrate and stay.  On May 28, 2013, the Magistrate Judge granted the motions to arbitrate and stayed proceedings pending arbitration.  On June 10, 2013, Archer moved for reconsideration before the District Court judge.  On December 7, 2016, the District Court Judge granted Archer’s motion for reconsideration and lifted the stay.  Defendants appealed the District Court’s order.  On December 21, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s order denying the motions to compel arbitration.  On February 12, 2018, defendants filed an Application for Stay of Proceedings in the District Court in the Supreme Court of the United States, seeking to stay proceedings in the District Court pending a decision on defendants’ forthcoming petition for writ of certiorari.  On June 25, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States granted defendants’ petition for writ of certiorari. On October 29, 2018, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments.  On January 8, 2019, the Supreme Court issued its published decision vacating the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and remanding the case to the Fifth Circuit for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court’s opinion.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. 
 
On August 17, 2017, IQ Dental Supply, Inc. (“IQ Dental”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, entitled IQ Dental Supply, Inc. v. Henry Schein, Inc., Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company, Case No. 2:17-cv-4834.  Plaintiff alleges that it is a distributor of dental supplies and equipment, and sells dental products through an online dental distribution platform operated by SourceOne Dental (“SourceOne”).  SourceOne had previously brought an antitrust lawsuit against Henry Schein, Patterson and Benco, which Henry Schein settled in the second quarter of 2017 and which is described in our prior filings with the SEC.
 
IQ Dental alleges, among other things, that defendants conspired to suppress competition from IQ Dental and SourceOne for the marketing, distribution and sale of dental supplies and equipment in the United States, and that defendants unlawfully agreed with one another to boycott dentists, manufacturers and state dental associations that deal with, or considered dealing with, plaintiff and SourceOne.  Plaintiff claims that this alleged conduct constitutes unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, New York’s Donnelly Act and the New Jersey Antitrust Act, and also makes pendant state law claims for tortious interference with prospective business relations, civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting.  Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, compensatory, treble and punitive damages, jointly and severally, and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees.  On December 21, 2017, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss.  On January 19, 2018, IQ Dental appealed the District Court’s order.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral argument on the appeal on September 13, 2018.  The court’s decision is pending.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action.
 
On February 12, 2018, the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed a complaint against Benco Dental Supply Co., Henry Schein, Inc. and Patterson Companies, Inc. The FTC alleges, among other things, that

defendants violated U.S. antitrust laws by conspiring, and entering into an agreement, to refuse to provide discounts to or otherwise serve buying groups representing dental practitioners.  The FTC alleges that defendants conspired in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.  The complaint seeks equitable relief only and does not seek monetary damages.  We deny the allegation that we conspired to refuse to provide discounts to or otherwise serve dental buying groups and intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. A hearing before an administrative law judge began on October 16, 2018 and is ongoing.  We believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
 
On March 7, 2018, Joseph Salkowitz, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint for violation of the federal securities laws against Henry Schein, Inc., Stanley M. Bergman and Steven Paladino in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Case No. 1:18-cv-01428.  The complaint sought to certify a class consisting of all persons and entities who, subject to certain exclusions, purchased Henry Schein securities from March 7, 2013 through February 12, 2018 (the “Class Period”).  The complaint alleged, among other things, that the defendants had made materially false and misleading statements about Henry Schein’s business, operations and prospects during the Class Period, including matters relating to the issues in the antitrust class action and the FTC action described above, thereby causing the plaintiff and members of the purported class to pay artificially inflated prices for Henry Schein securities.  The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”), the court appointed lead plaintiff and lead counsel on June 22, 2018 and recaptioned the putative class action as In re Henry Schein, Inc. Securities Litigation, under the same case number.  Lead plaintiff filed a consolidated class action complaint on September 14, 2018.  The consolidated class action complaint asserts similar claims against the same defendants (plus Timothy Sullivan) on behalf of the same putative class of purchasers during the Class Period.  It alleges that Henry Schein’s stock price was inflated during that period because Henry Schein had misleadingly portrayed its dental-distribution business “as successfully producing excellent profits while operating in a highly competitive environment” even though, “in reality, [Henry Schein] had engaged for years in collusive and anticompetitive practices in order to maintain Schein’s margins, profits, and market share.”  The complaint alleges that the stock price started to fall from August 8, 2017, when the company announced below-expected financial performance that allegedly “revealed that Schein’s poor results were a product of abandoning prior attempts to inflate sales volume and margins through anticompetitive collusion,” through February 13, 2018, after the FTC filed a complaint against Benco, Henry Schein and Patterson alleging that they violated U.S. antitrust laws.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. Henry Schein has also received a request under 8 Del. C. § 220 to inspect corporate books and records relating to the issues raised in the securities class action and the antitrust matters discussed above.
On May 3, 2018, a purported class action complaint, Marion Diagnostic Center, LLC, et al. v. Becton, Dickinson, and Co., et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-010509, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois against Becton, Dickinson, and Co. (“Becton”); Premier, Inc. (“Premier”), Vizient, Inc. (“Vizient”), Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”), Owens & Minor Inc. (“O&M”), Henry Schein, Inc., and Unnamed Becton Distributor Co-Conspirators.  The complaint alleges that the defendants entered into a vertical conspiracy to force healthcare providers into long-term exclusionary contracts that restrain trade in the nationwide markets for conventional and safety syringes and safety IV catheters and inflate the prices of certain Becton products to above-competitive levels.  The named plaintiffs seek to represent three separate classes consisting of all healthcare providers that purchased (i) Becton’s conventional syringes, (ii) Becton’s safety syringes, or (iii) Becton’s safety catheters directly from Becton, Premier, Vizient, Cardinal, O&M or Henry Schein on or after May 3, 2014.  The complaint asserts a single count under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seeks equitable relief, treble damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs and expenses, and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.  On June 15, 2018, an amended complaint was filed asserting the same allegations against the same parties and adding McKesson Medical-Surgical, Inc. as an additional defendant.  On November 30, 2018, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss and entered a final judgment, dismissing plaintiffs’ complaint with prejudice.  On December 27,

2018, plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action.
 
On May 29, 2018, an amended complaint was filed in the MultiDistrict Litigation (“MDL”) proceeding In Re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804; Case No. 17-md-2804) in an action entitled The County of Summit, Ohio et al. v. Purdue Pharma, L.P., et al., Civil Action No. 1:18-op-45090-DAP (“County of  Summit Action”), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, adding Henry Schein, Inc., Henry Schein Medical Systems, Inc. and others as defendants.  Plaintiffs allege that manufacturers of prescription opioid drugs engaged in a false advertising campaign to expand the market for such drugs and their own market share and that the entities in the supply chain (including Henry Schein, Inc. and Henry Schein Medical Systems, Inc.) reaped financial rewards by refusing or otherwise failing to monitor appropriately and restrict the improper distribution of those drugs.  Plaintiffs assert the following claims for relief against Henry Schein, Inc. and Henry Schein Medical Systems, Inc.: statutory public nuisance; common law absolute public nuisance; negligence; injury through criminal acts (R.C. 2307.60); unjust enrichment; and civil conspiracy.   This case has been designated “Track 1” and is currently set for trial on October 21, 2019.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. 
 
In addition to the Summit County Action, Henry Schein and/or one or more of its affiliated companies have currently been named as a defendant in twenty-one (21) additional lawsuits, which allege claims similar to those alleged in the Summit County Action.  None of these other cases have been set for trial.  These actions consist of some that have been consolidated within the MDL and are currently abated for discovery purposes, and others which remain pending in state courts and are proceeding independently and outside of the MDL.   Sales of opioids in North America from October 2017 through October 2018 were less than 1% of all North American sales.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these actions.
 
On October 9, 2018, a purported class action complaint entitled Kramer v. Henry Schein, Inc., Patterson Co., Inc., Benco Dental Supply Co., and Unnamed Co-Conspirators, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  The complaint alleges that members of the proposed class, comprised of purchasers of dental services from dental practices in California, suffered antitrust injury due to an unlawful boycott, price-fixing or otherwise anticompetitive conspiracy among Henry Schein, Patterson and Benco.  The complaint alleges that the alleged conspiracy overcharged California dental practices, orthodontic practices and dental laboratories on their purchase of dental supplies, which in turn passed on some or all of such overcharges to members of the California class purchasing dental services.  Subject to certain exclusions, the complaint defines the class as “all persons residing in California purchasing and/or reimbursing for dental services from California dental practices on or after August 31, 2012.” The complaint alleges violations of California antitrust laws, including the Cartwright Act (Cal. Bus. and Prof. Code § 16720) and the Unfair Competition Act (Cal. Bus. and Prof. Code § 17200), and seeks a permanent injunction, actual damages to be determined at trial, trebled, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest.  On December 7, 2018, an amended complaint was filed asserting the same claims against the same parties.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action.
 
On January 29, 2019, a purported class action complaint was filed by R. Lawrence Hatchett, M.D. against Henry Schein, Inc., Patterson Co., Inc., Benco Dental Supply Co., and unnamed co-conspirators in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.  The complaint alleges that members of the proposed class suffered antitrust injury due to an unlawful boycott, price-fixing or otherwise anticompetitive conspiracy among Henry Schein, Patterson and Benco. The complaint alleges that the alleged conspiracy overcharged Illinois dental practices, orthodontic practices and dental laboratories on their purchase of dental supplies, which in turn passed on some or all of such overcharges to members of the class.  Subject to certain exclusions, the complaint defines the class as “all persons residing in Illinois purchasing and/or reimbursing for dental care provided by independent Illinois dental practices purchasing dental supplies from the defendants, or purchasing from buying groups purchasing these supplies from the defendants, on or after January 29, 2015.”  The complaint alleges violations of the Illinois Antitrust Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. §§ 10/3(2), 10/7(2), and seeks a permanent injunction, actual

damages to be determined at trial, trebled, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action.
  
From time to time, we may become a party to other legal proceedings, including, without limitation, product liability claims, employment matters, commercial disputes, governmental inquiries and investigations (which may in some cases involve our entering into settlement arrangements or consent decrees), and other matters arising out of the ordinary course of our business.  While the results of any legal proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty, in our opinion none of these other pending matters are currently anticipated to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
 
As of December 29, 2018, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to claims that were probable to result in liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss.  This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other factors, including probable recoveries from third parties.

Note 20 – Supplemental Cash Flow Information  
 
Cash paid for interest and income taxes was: 
  



 
There was approximately $0.0 million, $0.4 million and $63.8 million of debt assumed as a part of the acquisitions for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  Debt assumed during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to the acquisitions of Dental Cremer S.A. and Dental Speed Graph.
 
For the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $1.0 million, $(1.5) million and $(1.0) million of non-cash net unrealized gains (losses) related to foreign currency hedging activities, respectively. During the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, as part of business acquisitions, we increased our ownerships in subsidiaries through non-cash transactions of $1.4 million and $17.6 million, respectively.
 
During the third quarter of 2018, we closed on a joint venture with Internet Brands to create a newly formed entity, Henry Schein One, LLC, through a non-cash transaction resulting in an initial estimate of approximately $385 million of noncontrolling interest representing Internet Brands’ current 26% minority interest and an initial estimate of $182.6 million of deferred additional ownership interests of Internet Brands in Henry Schein One, representing up to an additional 9.2% ownership interests, a portion of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain operating targets (See Note 9).
  
 
Note 21 – Subsequent Event
 
On February 7, 2019 (the “Distribution Date”), we completed the previously announced separation (the “Separation”) and subsequent merger of our animal health business (the “Henry Schein Animal Health Business”) with Direct Vet Marketing, Inc. (d/b/a Vets First Choice, “Vets First Choice”) (the “Merger”).  This was accomplished by a series of transactions among us, Vets First Choice, Covetrus, Inc. (f/k/a HS Spinco, Inc. “Covetrus”), a wholly owned subsidiary of ours prior to the Distribution Date, and HS Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Covetrus (“Merger Sub”).  In connection with the Separation, we contributed, assigned and transferred to Covetrus certain applicable assets, liabilities and capital stock or other ownership interests relating to the Henry Schein Animal Health Business.  On the Distribution Date, we received a tax-free distribution of $1,120.0 million from Covetrus pursuant to certain debt financing incurred by Covetrus.  On the Distribution Date and prior to the Distribution, Covetrus issued shares of Covetrus common stock to certain institutional accredited investors (the “Share Sale Investors”) for $361.1 million (the “Share Sale”).  The proceeds of the Share Sale were paid to Covetrus and distributed to us.  Subsequent to the Share Sale, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of the common stock of Covetrus held by us to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2019 (the “Animal Health Spin-off”).  After the Share Sale and Animal Health Spin-off, Merger Sub consummated the Merger whereby it merged with and into Vets First Choice, with Vets First Choice surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Covetrus.  Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, on a fully diluted basis, (i) approximately 63% of the shares of Covetrus common stock were (a) owned by our stockholders and the Share Sale Investors, and (b) in respect of certain equity awards held by certain employees of the Henry Schein Animal Health Business, and (ii) approximately 37% of the shares of Covetrus common stock were (a) owned by stockholders of Vets First Choice immediately prior to the Merger, and (b) in respect of certain

equity awards held by certain employees of Vets First Choice.  After the Separation and the Merger, we no longer beneficially owned any shares of Covetrus common stock and, following the Distribution Date, will not consolidate the financial results of Covetrus for the purpose of our financial reporting.  Following the Separation and the Merger, Covetrus was an independent, publicly traded company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
 
Effective first quarter 2019, we will report the historical earnings of the Henry Schein Animal Health Business as a discontinued operation.  The Company estimates that on a continuing operations basis, its 2018 revenues were $9.4 billion and its 2018 net income was $430.7 million.

ITEM 9A.  Controls and Procedures
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 29, 2018 to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. 
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
The combination of acquisitions, continued acquisition integrations and systems implementations undertaken during the quarter and carried over from prior quarters, when considered in the aggregate, represents a material change in our internal control over financial reporting.
 
During the quarter ended December 29, 2018, post-acquisition integration related activities continued for our global dental, technology and animal health businesses acquired during prior quarters, representing aggregate annual revenues of approximately $362 million.  These acquisitions, the majority of which utilize separate information and financial accounting systems, have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.   
 
Also, during the quarter ended December 29, 2018, post-implementation systems improvement activities continued for a new equipment system implemented during prior quarters for our U.S. dental business representing approximate aggregate annual revenues of $453 million. 
 
All acquisitions integrations and systems implementations involved necessary and appropriate change-management controls that are considered in our annual assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), updated and reissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, or the COSO Framework. Based on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 29, 2018.
 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018 has been independently audited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their attestation is included herein.

133






 

 

 
Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control 
 
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 

 
Stockholders and Board of Directors 
Henry Schein, Inc.
Melville, NY 
 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
We have audited Henry Schein Inc.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”).  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.  
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2018, and the related notes and schedule and our report dated February 20, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
 
Basis for Opinion
 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Item 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 

135






 


 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BUSINESSGeneralCore Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry. These services and products can enable our clients to improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from their producing fields. We have over 70 offices in more than 50 countries and have approximately 4,700 employees.References to "Core Lab", "the Company", "we", "our", and similar phrases are used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") and relate collectively to Core Laboratories N.V. and its consolidated affiliates.In the first quarter of 2018, in a continuing effort to streamline our business and align our business strategy for further integration of services and products, the Company committed to divest the business of our full range of permanent downhole monitoring systems and related services, which had been part of our Production Enhancement segment. All prior period income statements have been adjusted to reclassify amounts related to this business to discontinued operations to conform to current period presentation. All disclosures on operating income and net income within these statements reflect the results from continuing operations for all periods presented. These reclassifications had no impact on the reported net income attributable to Core Laboratories N.V., financial position or cash flows for any of these prior periods.Business StrategyOur business strategy is to provide advanced technologies that improve reservoir performance by (i) continuing the development of proprietary technologies through client-driven research and development, (ii) expanding the services and products offered throughout our global network of offices and (iii) acquiring complementary technologies that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing services and products.Development of New Technologies, Services and Products We conduct research and development to meet the needs of our clients who are continually seeking new services and technologies to lower their costs of finding, developing and producing oil and gas. While the aggregate number of wells being drilled per year has fluctuated relative to market conditions, oil and gas producers have, on a proportional basis, increased expenditures on technology services to improve their understanding of the reservoir and increase production of oil and gas from their producing fields. We intend to continue concentrating our efforts on services and technologies that improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery.International Expansion of Services and Products Another component of our business strategy is to broaden the spectrum of services and products offered to our clients on a global basis. We intend to continue using our worldwide network of offices to offer our services and products that have been developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. This global emphasis allows us to enhance our revenue through efficient utilization of our worldwide network.Acquisitions We continually review potential acquisitions to add key services and technologies, enhance market presence or complement existing businesses.More information relating to any significant acquisitions is included in Note 4, Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV of this Form 10-K ("Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").OperationsWe derive our revenue from services and product sales to clients primarily in the oil and gas industry. 1We operate our business in two reporting segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. Disclosure relating to the operations and financial information of these business segments is included in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We offer our services worldwide through our global network of offices. Services accounted for 69%, 74% and 79% of our revenue from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.We manufacture products primarily in five facilities for distribution on a global basis. Product sales accounted for 31%, 26% and 21% of our revenue from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Our product sales backlog at December 31, 2018 was $16.9 million compared to $17.5 million at December 31, 2017. Sources of raw materials for our products are readily available, and we expect that our current sales backlog at December 31, 2018 will be completed in 2019.Reservoir Description Commercial oil and gas fields consist of porous and permeable reservoir rocks that contain natural gas, crude oil and water. Due to the density differences of the fluids, natural gas typically caps the field and overlies an oil layer, which overlies the water. We provide services that characterize the porous reservoir rock and all three reservoir fluids. Services relating to these fluids include determining quality and measuring quantity of the fluids and their derived products. This includes determining the value of different crude oil and natural gases by analyzing the individual components of complex hydrocarbons. We measure these hydrocarbons at reservoir conditions to determine the changes in their physical properties with changing pressure and temperature. The number of pressure-volume-temperature ("PVT") related projects has been increasing for the last several years, and reservoir fluid analyses now contribute approximately 60% of Reservoir Description revenue.We analyze samples of reservoir rocks for their porosity, which determines reservoir storage capacity, and for their permeability, which defines the ability of the fluids to flow through the rock. These measurements are used to determine how much oil and gas are present in a reservoir and the rates at which the oil and gas can be produced. We also use our proprietary services and technologies to correlate the reservoir description data to wireline logs and seismic data by determining the different acoustic velocities of reservoir rocks containing water, oil and natural gas. The combined use of both the reservoir rock and fluid data are invaluable to oil companies to determine the most efficient method by which to recover, process, and refine these hydrocarbons to produce the maximum value added to crude oil and natural gas fields. Early evaluations and key decisions about well performance and viability are important for optimizing a reservoir. This is accomplished using our Digital Rock Characteristics ("DRC") services which include (1) Dual Energy Computed Tomography ("DECT") which is a non-destructive petrophysical evaluation technique to provide early time insight of reservoir lithology and reservoir quality; and (2) Micro Computed Tomography which is a high resolution pore imaging service that provides early time quantification of both routine and special core analysis properties.Core Lab's proprietary DECT scanner-based deliverables generate millimeter-scale three dimensional images and accompanying high-resolution petrophysical logs on cored intervals by calibrating DECT information to the vast library of physical measurements in Core Lab's proprietary database. The DECT deliverables from Core Lab are more detailed than down-hole logs and provide better bed resolution as well as accurate information on rock properties such as lithology, porosity, density, rock strength and acoustic properties.We have developed unique analytical processes to understand the flow characteristics and saturation profiles of unconventional reservoir systems including (1) High Frequency Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ("NMR") measurements to allow the T1/T2 mapping to gain understanding of movable vs. non-movable fluid saturation distribution of these complex systems; and (2) Enhanced Oil Recovery ("EOR") of shale reservoirs by evaluating the effectiveness of gas cycling in nano-pore structures to significantly increase long-term production rates and volumes. 2Core Lab holds various patents, trade secrets, and proprietary designs for laboratory equipment required to analyze reservoir rocks as well as the properties and phase behavior of reservoir fluids. We manufacture a wide range of ambient and reservoir condition rock and fluid analysis laboratory equipment for our own use throughout our international laboratory network. Among these devices are complex, high-pressure, high temperature, reservoir condition, multi-phase flow systems and full visualization PVT cells, along with the ancillary equipment required to support these laboratory programs. We also sell equipment of this type to universities, government institutes, and client company research labs.While recognizing the need to optimize the logistical chain of our clients, from producing well to retail sales of petroleum products, a state-of-the-art IT platform CONNECT: was launched to efficiently acquire our field data, laboratory analysis and any other observations relevant to our client base. The system is designed for single data entry, and that data can be used for further analysis and, more importantly, be shared with our clients by process flow dashboards with key performance indicators. The system can also share real-time data on mobile devices, enabling our clients to make quick decisions.This methodology of sharing data has been embraced by an increasing number of clients, as it has not only saved them costs, but, more importantly, the data can be used for trend analysis in many ways, such as the ability to forecast bottlenecks, thus eliminating waste and increasing efficiency.Two experience centers have been set up, both in the U.S. and Europe, where our clients can get acquainted with optimizing the flow of business as well as our advanced systems for data analysis. All initiatives are meant to increase efficiency and add value to our client base. New modules continue to be added to our suite of IT platforms that enhance the distribution chain of our customers, with further development continuing during 2019.We are involved in numerous large-scale reservoir management projects, applying proprietary and state-of-the-art techniques from the earliest phases of a field development program until the last economic barrel of oil is recovered. These projects are of increasing importance to oil companies as the incremental barrel is often the lowest cost and most profitable barrel in the reservoir. Producing incremental barrels increases our clients' cash flows which we believe will result in additional capital expenditures by our clients, and ultimately further opportunities for us. Some of these are industry consortium projects that provide critical reservoir information to a broad spectrum of clients in a cost effective manner. Many of them examine unconventional reservoirs, particularly in the US and Canada. For example, our Permian Basin study evaluates the petrophysical, geochemical, completion and production characteristics of this very active play in West Texas. Our clients use this information, not only to improve their drilling and production activities, but also to evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture opportunities. Outside of North America, we have an ongoing global shale study that examines the unconventional reservoir potential in Central and Southern Europe, North Africa, India, China and Australia, among other regions. We also have studies focused on tight sandstone reservoirs around the world and unconventional plays in the Middle East.During 2018, we launched a joint industry project ("JIP") focused on evaluation of unconventional Mississippian reservoirs in the SCOOP and STACK areas of the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. This JIP will evaluate geological, geochemical and petrophysical characteristics of conventional cores to develop a stratigraphic model for the study area, calibrate wireline logs to reflect physical measurements of the core samples, determine optimum landing zone targets and distances related to down-spacing, predict production potential and estimate ultimate crude oil recoveries. The data and interpretations will also be used to determine optimum completion techniques. In addition, a SCOOP-STACK Rock Catalog will be developed using our proprietary methodology and data analytics techniques. This catalog will allow clients to better evaluate the potential of wells from drill cuttings when conventional core is unavailable.During 2018, we also launched analytical JIP programs associated with unconventional Enhanced Oil Recovery ("EOR") for two basins in the United States:  the "Unconventional Enhanced Oil Recovery Permian Basin" ("Permian Basin EOR JIP") and the "Unconventional EOR in the Eagle Ford Formation" (the "Eagle Ford EOR JIP"). These studies are focused on incremental oil recovery from cyclic engineered-gas injection in the formation. The Permian Basin EOR JIP, focused on the Wolfcamp Formation in both the Midland and Delaware Basins, follows two successful Core Lab JIPs in the Midland and Delaware Basins, which were conducted for over 75 operators. Those earlier studies focused on the geological and petrophysical properties of target reservoir horizons, and therefore provide a critical foundation for the recently initiated unconventional EOR JIP in the Wolfcamp Formation. In the Eagle Ford EOR JIP, participants will furnish a large variety of reservoir cores and reservoir fluids from the Eagle Ford formation to be studied to determine the most effective techniques to boost ultimate recovery rates. Due to steep decline curves and low recovery factors, there is a need to assess the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery techniques in these nano-darcy rocks.  The technological and analytical methodologies used in these new Unconventional EOR JIPs are the summation of years of proprietary experience in unconventional EOR testing and in  3providing analytical data sets to operators to help them optimize their reservoirs. Core Lab plans to follow the Eagle Ford EOR JIP and Permian Basin EOR JIP with similar JIPs in other applicable unconventional reservoirs in North and South America.Apart from unconventional settings, several conventional reservoir studies are currently being conducted for the deep water Gulf of Mexico and several different plays around the offshore Atlantic margins of South America and Canada. Onshore, we have also conducted dozens of conventional reservoir studies on every continent except Antarctica.Production Enhancement We provide diagnostic services and products to help optimize completion and reservoir operations and field development strategies in order to increase recoverable reserves in the most efficient way. Two production enhancement methods commonly used are (i) hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir rock to improve flow and (ii) flooding a reservoir with water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen or hydrocarbon gases to force more oil and gas to the wellbore. Many oilfields today are hydraulically fractured and/or flooded to maximize oil and gas recovery. Although Core Lab is not a hydraulic fracturing company, we do provide services that are used by others to develop and optimize hydraulic fracturing and field flood projects and to evaluate the success of those projects. Our services, technologies and expertise play a key role in the success of both methods.The hydraulic fracturing of a producing formation is achieved by pumping a fluid slurry containing a proppant material into the reservoir zone at extremely high pressures. This fractures the rock and the proppant material "props" or holds the fractures open after the pressure pumping is complete so that reservoir fluids can flow to the production wellbore. Our data on rock type and strength are critical for determining the proper design of the hydraulic fracturing job. In addition, our testing indicates whether the fluid slurry is compatible with the reservoir rock so that damage does not occur that would restrict production. We also provide testing of various propping agents and software to help pick the best proppant based on net present value calculations of client investments. Our proprietary and patented ZERO WASH® tracer technology is used to determine cluster efficiency and ensure maximum stimulated reservoir volume and increased ultimate recovery.SPECTRACHEM® is another proprietary and patented technology developed for optimizing hydraulic fracture performance. SPECTRACHEM® is used to aid operators in determining the efficiency of the fracture fluids used. SPECTRACHEM® tracers allow operators to evaluate the quantity of fracture fluid that returns to the wellbore during the clean-up period after a hydraulic fracturing event. This technology also allows our clients to evaluate load recovery, gas breakthrough, fluid leak-off and breaker efficiency, all of which are important factors for optimizing oil and/or natural gas production after the formation is hydraulically fractured. The SPECTRACHEM® service is effective in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of the hydraulic fracture stimulation of long multi-stage horizontal wells in oil- and gas-shale plays throughout North America and with growing demand internationally as unconventional resource plays are developed globally. SPECTRACHEM® data sets are used to determine how each frac stage is flowing. Frac stages with ineffective flows may warrant further stimulation, remedial actions and guide improvements on future frac designs.Our unique completion monitoring system, COMPLETION PROFILER™, helps to determine flow rates from reservoir zones after they have been hydraulically fractured. This provides our clients with a baseline of early production information and can be compared to subsequent production logs later in the life of the well to see how hydrocarbon production from different reservoir layers or different quality rock varies over time.Our FLOWPROFILERTM service, a proprietary hydrocarbon-based tracer technology, which is a further development of our patented SPECTRACHEM® technology quantifies the hydrocarbon production from discrete segments in multi-stage horizontal well completions and stimulations in unconventional tight-oil or gas plays. We have tracers used for oil reservoirs which are different from our tracers used for gas reservoirs. FLOWPROFILERTM technology and the analytical methodology for identifying the hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are the protected intellectual property of Core Lab.FLOWPROFILERTM technology employs a unique hydrocarbon-soluble tracer and water-soluble tracer introduced into specific and isolated stages via the stimulating proppant stream. The hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are absorbed by the crude oil and gas associated with each stage while the water-soluble tracer remains in the stimulation fluid. When the well is flowed, oil, gas and water samples are collected and analyzed in the laboratory to identify and quantify oil or gas flows from each stage and the cleanup of the stimulation fluid. Stages not at optimum flow rates can be identified, precipitating remedial efforts to increase flow and recovery rates, and to provide valuable insight for future wells. This service is being used to monitor offset well interference by sampling offset well oil, gas and water production. The amount of tracer detected in offset wells is being used to help our clients optimize both lateral and vertical well spacing and the amount of fracturing fluids for each stage. 4During 2018, we saw broadening acceptance of FLOWPROFILERTMEDS, a proprietary technology, which is an engineered delivery system ("EDS"). The break-through EDS technology delivers time-released diagnostics for evaluating the crude oil flow from each stage of a hydraulically fractured completion. This technology comprises proprietary 40/70 or 100 mesh particles, chemically engineered to bond specifically with our oil tracers. This allows for precise placement of tracers in the propped fracture providing accurate identification of oil production by stage. Crude oil production by stage is determined by using this Core Lab-developed technology that enables the diagnostic tracer to be absorbed and chemically-bonded to durable, proppant-size particles that accompany the frac sand. The tracer will release from the engineered particles once they contact the reservoir's crude oil, enabling Core Lab to assess which stages are contributing to crude oil production.We conduct dynamic flow tests of the reservoir fluids through the reservoir rock, at actual reservoir pressure and temperature, to realistically simulate the actual flooding of a producing zone. We use patented technologies, such as our Saturation Monitoring by the Attenuation of X-rays ("SMAX™"), to help design the enhanced recovery project. After a field flood is initiated, we are often involved in monitoring the progress of the flood to ensure the maximum amount of incremental production is being achieved through the use of our SPECTRAFLOODTM technology, which we developed to optimize sweep efficiency during field floods.Our PACKSCAN® patented technology is used to evaluate gravel pack effectiveness in unconsolidated reservoirs. PACKSCAN® measures the density changes in the gravel pack annulus to verify the completeness of the gravel pack protection of the wellbore without any additional rig time.In addition to Core Lab's many patented reservoir analysis technologies, Production Enhancement has established itself as a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of high-performance perforating products. Core Lab's unique understanding of complex reservoirs supports our ability to supply perforating systems engineered to maximize well productivity by reducing, eliminating and overcoming formation damage caused during the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells. This "systems" approach to the perforation of an oil or gas well has resulted in numerous patented products. HERO® ("High Efficiency Reservoir Optimization"), SUPERHERO® and SUPERHERO®Plus are examples of the patented perforating systems which quickly gained market acceptance and became industry leaders in enhancing reservoir performance. The SUPERHERO® and SUPERHERO®Plus charges evolved from HERO® charge technology and use a proprietary and patented design of powdered metal liners and explosives technology resulting in a deeper and cleaner perforating tunnel into the oil and gas reservoir. This allows greater flow of hydrocarbons to the wellbore and helps to maximize hydrocarbon recovery from the reservoir. The more recent charge development of the HERO® Hard Rock or HERO®-HR charges, resulted in Core Lab also having the deepest penetrating perforating charges on the market as certified by API testing. HERO®PerFRAC is the newest next generation of charges using HERO® technology. In addition to the benefits of HERO® technology, HERO®PerFRAC charges are designed specifically for optimizing fracture stimulation well completions by providing a uniform hole size which minimizes tortuosity effects in the rock during well stimulation resulting in less surface horsepower and less time which both translate into lower costs needed to initiate the fracturing operation. In addition to optimizing stimulation operations with faster, lower cost programs, the production is also enhanced by not only the better well stimulations but the improved near debris free perforation tunnels as the well fluids come back into the casing from the rock. Core Lab's manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada continue to meet the global demand for our perforating systems through facility expansion in addition to gains in efficiency and productivity.The HERO® line of perforating charges, HERO®PerFRAC, SUPERHERO® and SUPERHERO®Plus charges can eliminate the ineffective perforations that would otherwise limit daily oil and natural gas production and hinder the optimal fracture stimulation programs needed for prolific production from the Permian Basin, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Niobrara and similar oil- and gas-shale formations.During 2018, Core Lab completed the acquisition of Guardian Global Technologies Ltd. ("Guardian"). Based in Pyle, Wales, Guardian is a technologically sophisticated designer and manufacturer of downhole instrumentation utilized by international oil and gas operators for well completions. Guardian’s proprietary downhole energetic solutions are designed to systemize, simplify, automate, and de-risk the deployment of perforating systems. The Ballistics Delivery System (BDS)TM provides a unique range of perforating tools and equipment, which have been developed to provide a number of advantages over existing technology. The BDS tools facilitate perforation accuracy while addressing wellbore assurance concerns and optimizing safety, thus alleviating some of the challenges often found when perforating, and assists with issues incurred with high underbalanced perforating, running heavy/long assemblies, oriented perforating, depth control, reduction in fishing risk, and acquiring wellbore pressure data as guns fire. 5Core Lab's Production Enhancement team has experienced technical services personnel to support clients through our global network of offices for the everyday use of our perforating systems and the rapid introduction of new products. Our personnel are capable of providing client training and on-site services in the completion of oil and gas wells. The patented X-SPAN® and GTX-SPAN® casing patches are supported by our technical services personnel. Recent market applications in Canada's steam-assisted gravity drainage ("SAGD") environment have resulted in an upgrade in temperature ratings to as much as 600°F. These systems are capable of performing in high temperature as well as high pressure oil and gas environments and are used to seal non-productive reservoir zones from the producing wellbore.Marketing and SalesWe market and sell our services and products through a combination of sales representatives, technical seminars, trade shows and print advertising. Direct sales and marketing are carried out by our sales force, technical experts and operating managers, as well as by sales representatives and distributors in various markets where we do not have offices. Our Business Development group manages a Large Account Management Program to better serve our largest and most active clients by meeting with key personnel within their organizations to ensure the quality of our services and products are meeting their expectations and  addressing any issues or needs in a timely manner.Research and DevelopmentThe market for our services and products is characterized by changing technology and frequent product introduction. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new services and products on a cost-effective basis and to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner. Many of our acquisitions have allowed us to obtain the benefits of the acquired company's research and development projects without incurring significant costs if we had attempted to develop the services and products ourselves. We incur costs as part of internal research and development, and these costs are charged to expense as incurred. We intend to continue committing financial resources and effort to the development and acquisition of new services and products. Over the years, we have made a number of technological advances, including the development of key technologies utilized in our operations. Substantially all of our new technologies are the result of requests and guidance from our clients, particularly major oil companies.Patents and TrademarksWe believe our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are an important factor in maintaining our technological advantage, although no single one of these is considered essential to our success. Typically, we will seek to protect our intellectual property in all jurisdictions where we believe the cost of such protection is warranted. While we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology even where regarded as patentable. We protect our intellectual property, including through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements, legal enforcement proceedings and by other means.International OperationsWe operate facilities in more than 50 countries. Our non-U.S. operations accounted for 54%, 56% and 62% of our revenue from operations during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We attribute service revenue to the country in which the service was performed rather than where the reservoir or project is located while we attribute product sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of service revenue performed and recorded in the U.S. that are sourced from projects on non-U.S. oilfields. The following graphs and table summarize our reported revenue by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: 6While we are subject to fluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates relating to our international operations, we attempt to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by limiting the amount in which our foreign contracts are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. However, the ultimate decision as to the proportion of the foreign currency component within a contract usually resides with our clients. Consequently, we are not always able to eliminate our foreign currency exposure. We have not historically engaged in and are not currently engaged in any significant currency hedging or trading transactions designed to compensate for adverse currency fluctuations. Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health RegulationsWe are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to protection of the environment and occupational safety and health. Compliance with environmental legal requirements in the United States at the federal, state or local levels may require acquiring permits to conduct regulated activities, incurring capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions, discharges and any unauthorized releases, and complying with stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes.  Additionally, our operations in the United Sates are subject to stringent occupational safety and health laws and regulations, which are intended to protect worker health and safety.  Foreign countries in which we conduct operations may also have analogous controls that regulate our environmental and worker safety-related activities, which controls may impose additional, or more stringent requirements.  Consistent with our quality assurance and control principles, we have established proactive environmental and worker safety policies in the United States and foreign countries for the management, handling, recycling or disposal of chemicals and gases and other materials and wastes resulting from our operations.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective obligations, the occurrence of delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of injunctive relief in affected areas.  Historically, our environmental and worker safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.New, modified or stricter enforcement of environmental laws and regulations could be adopted or implemented that significantly increase our compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs, or the cost of any remediation of environmental contamination that may become necessary, and these costs could be material.  Our clients are also subject to most, if not all, of the same laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Consequently, to the extent these environmental compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs or remedial costs are incurred by our clients, those clients could elect to delay, restrict or cancel drilling, exploration or production programs, which could reduce demand for our products and services and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Our and our clients’ compliance with such existing, or any new or amended legal requirements that are placed into effect and applicable in areas where we  or our clients conduct operations, could result in our or our clients’ incurring significant additional expense and operating restrictions.  Our costs may not be fully recoverable from our clients and, thus, could reduce net income. To the extent any such existing or future legal requirements result in increased costs or restrictions or cancellation  7in the operation of our clients, to whom we provide our services, such developments could reduce demand for our products and services and have an indirect material adverse effect on our business.Additionally, our analytical and manufacturing processes involve the handling and use of numerous chemicals and gases as well as the generation of wastes. Spills or other unauthorized releases of these chemicals, gases, and wastes at our facilities, whether by us or prior owners or operators, or at offsite locations where we transport them for recycling or disposal, could subject us to environmental liability, either from the applicable government agency or private landowners or other third parties. Such liabilities could be strict, joint and several, as is applicable in the United States under such laws as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. This could also include costs of cleaning up chemicals and wastes released into the environment and for damages to persons, properties or natural resources. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), remediate environmental contamination (including contaminated groundwater), and undertake measures to prevent future contamination. We may not be able to recover some or any of these remedial or corrective costs from insurance.CompetitionThe businesses in which we engage are competitive. Some of our competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of companies that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have. While no one company competes with us in all of our product and service lines, we face competition in these lines, primarily from independent regional companies and internal divisions of major integrated oil and gas companies. We compete in different product and service lines to various degrees on the basis of price, technical performance, availability, quality and technical support. Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including successful and timely development of new services and products, performance and quality, client service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends.Reliance on the Oil and Gas IndustryOur business and operations are substantially dependent upon the condition of the global oil and gas industry. Future downturns in the oil and gas industry, or in the oilfield services business, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times as a result of numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including the level of capital expenditures of the oil and gas industry, the level of drilling activity, the level of production activity, market prices of oil and gas, economic conditions existing in the world, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulations, tax policies, political requirements of national governments, coordination by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC"), cost of producing oil and natural gas, and technological advances.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,700 employees. We do not have any material collective bargaining agreements and consider relations with our employees to be good.Web Site Access to Our Periodic SEC ReportsOur primary internet address is http://www.corelab.com. We file or furnish Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These reports are available free of charge through our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed or furnished electronically with the SEC. We may from time to time provide important disclosures to investors by posting them in the investor relations section of our web site, as allowed by SEC rules.The SEC maintains an internet website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding our company that we file electronically with the SEC. 8ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that may not prove to be accurate. All of our forward-looking information is, therefore, subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expected. All known, material risks and uncertainties are discussed below.Downturns in the oil and gas industry, or in the oilfield services business, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and demand for the majority of our oilfield services and products is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and generally dependent on the industry's view of future oil and gas prices. There are numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for our services and products, which are summarized as:The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oilfield services and products and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our operating results.Changes in macro-economic factors impacting the oil and gas industry may negatively affect our ability to accurately predict client demand, which could cause us to hold excess or obsolete inventory and experience a reduction in gross margins and financial results.We cannot accurately predict which or what level of our services and products our clients will need in the future. Orders are placed with our suppliers based on forecasts of client demand and, in some instances, we may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts of client demand are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into the estimates. In addition, many of our suppliers require a longer lead time to provide products than our clients demand for delivery of our finished products. If we overestimate client demand, we may allocate resources to the purchase of materials or manufactured products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to, if at all. As a result, we could hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce gross margin and adversely affect financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate client demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we could miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our client relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of service contracts or product orders could materially and adversely affect profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.We depend on the results of our international operations, which expose us to risks inherent in doing business abroad.We conduct our business in over 50 countries; business performed outside of the United States accounted for 54%, 56% and 62% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We attribute service revenue to the country in which the service was performed rather than where the reservoir or project is located while we attribute product  9sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of service revenue performed and recorded in the U.S. that are sourced from projects on non-U.S. oilfields.Our operations, and those of our clients, are subject to the various laws, regulations and other legal requirements of those respective countries as well as various risks peculiar to each country, which may include, but are not limited to:Historically, economic downturns and political events have resulted in lower demand for our services and products in certain markets. The continuing instability in the Middle East and North Africa and the potential for activity from terrorist groups that the U.S. government has cautioned against have further heightened our exposure to international risks. The global economy is highly influenced by public confidence in the geopolitical environment and the situation in the Middle East and North Africa continues to be highly fluid; therefore, we expect to experience heightened international risks.Our results of operations may be significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rate risk.We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. By the nature of our business, we derive a substantial amount of our revenue from our international operations, subjecting us to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Our results of operations may be adversely affected because our efforts to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws such as the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and the United Kingdom's Anti-Bribery Act (the "ABA") could restrict our ability to do business in foreign markets relative to our competitors who are not subject to these laws.We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may  conflict with local customs and practices. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or though other methods that we are prohibited from using.We are subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA and the ABA, which generally prohibits us and our intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. In particular, we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to these laws. Any such violations could result in substantial civil and/or criminal penalties and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our ability to continue to work in these parts of the world discussed above could be adversely affected if we were found to have violated certain laws, including the FCPA and the ABA.If we are not able to develop or acquire new products or our products become technologically obsolete, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 10The market for our services and products is characterized by changing technology and product introduction. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new services and products on a cost-effective basis and to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner. While we intend to continue committing substantial financial resources and effort to the development of new services and products, we may not be able to successfully differentiate our services and products from those of our competitors. Our clients may not consider our proposed services and products to be of value to them; or if the proposed services and products are of a competitive nature, our clients may not view them as superior to our competitors' services and products. In addition, we may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies, develop new products, or achieve and maintain technological advantages.If we are unable to continue developing competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our businesses and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, continuing development of new products inherently carries the risk of inventory obsolescence with respect to our older products.We are subject to the risk of supplier concentration.Certain of our product lines depend on a limited number of third party suppliers and vendors available in the marketplace. As a result of this concentration in some of our supply chains, our business and operations could be negatively affected if our key suppliers were to experience significant disruptions affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of their products. For example, we have a limited number of vendors for our manufactured product lines. The partial or complete loss of any one of our key suppliers, or a significant adverse change in the relationship with any of these suppliers, through consolidation or otherwise, would limit our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.If we are unable to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our services and products, our operating results may be adversely affected.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our services and products. To that end, we have obtained certain patents and intend to continue to seek patents on some of our inventions, services and products. While we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology, even when regarded as patentable. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain countries. Litigation, which could demand significant financial and management resources, may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights. Also, there can be no assurance that we can obtain licenses or other rights to necessary intellectual property on acceptable terms.There are risks relating to our acquisition strategy. If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage businesses that we have acquired and any businesses acquired in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.One of our key business strategies is to acquire technologies, operations and assets that are complementary to our existing businesses. There are financial, operational and legal risks inherent in any acquisition strategy, including:The success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to continue to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. 11We are subject to a variety of environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, which may result in increased costs and significant liability to our business.We are subject to a variety of stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and foreign countries relating to protection of the environment, and occupational health and safety. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for environmental liabilities, such as the remediation of historical contamination or recent spills, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the assessment of damages, fines and penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or cancellations in permitting or development of projects, or the suspension or cessation of some or all of our operations. These stringent laws and regulations could require us to acquire permits or other authorizations to conduct regulated activities, install and maintain costly equipment and pollution control technologies, impose specific safety and health standards addressing work protection, or to incur costs or liabilities to mitigate or remediate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former owners or operators. Additionally, our clients are also subject to most, if not all, of the same laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. To the extent existing environmental laws and regulations or any new or more stringently enforced environmental legal requirements significantly increase our clients’ compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs or remedial costs, our clients could elect to delay, restrict or cancel drilling, exploration or production programs, which could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For example, hydraulic fracturing continues to attract considerable public and governmental attention, both in the United States and in foreign countries, resulting in various controls applied to fracturing activities.Hydraulic fracturing is a process used by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells whereby water, sand or other proppants and chemical additives are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production. Some countries outside the United States, such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and France, currently have imposed moratoria on hydraulic fracturing while other countries, such as the United Kingdom, allow fracturing activities but those activities are not as widely pursued as they are in the United States. In the United States, the fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process.Additionally, a growing number of states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent disclosure, permitting and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, and local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of hydraulic fracturing activities.If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions related to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our exploration and production clients’ operate, those clients could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which could reduce demand for our products and services.See "Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations", under Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on environmental and worker safety and health matters.We may be unable to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable employees, which could adversely affect our business. Our success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled engineers, geologists and highly trained technicians, and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the oilfield services industry. In periods of high utilization, there may be a shortage of skilled and technical personnel available in the market, potentially compounding the difficulty of attracting and retaining these employees. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, make capital expenditures, fund our working capital requirements and pay our dividend, and our ability to generate cash may depend on factors beyond our control.  12Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures, and pay our dividend depends, in part, on our ability to generate cash in the future. This ability is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service and repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure that any refinancing or debt restructuring would be possible or, if possible, would be completed on favorable or acceptable terms, that any assets could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales would be favorable to us or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms.Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance our indebtedness, including our ability to borrow under our existing revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). Banks that are party to our existing Credit Facility may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time.Because we are a Netherlands company, it may be difficult for you to take legal action against our supervisory directors or us and it may not be possible to obtain or enforce judgments against us. Although we are a Netherlands company, our assets are located in a variety of countries. In addition, not all members of our supervisory board of directors are residents of the same countries as other supervisory directors. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within certain countries upon our supervisory directors, or to enforce against our supervisory directors or use judgments of courts of certain countries predicated upon civil liabilities under a country's federal securities laws. Because there is no treaty between certain countries and the Netherlands providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, some countries' judgments are not automatically enforceable in the Netherlands or in the United States, where the principal market for our shares is located. In addition, there is doubt as to whether a court in one country would impose civil liability on us or on the members of our supervisory board of directors in an original action brought against us or our supervisory directors in a court of competent jurisdiction in another country and predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of that other country.Our operations are subject to the risk of cyber-attacks that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. Our information technology systems are subject to possible breaches and other threats that could cause us harm. Although we devote significant resources to protect our systems, there can be no assurance that our systems will prevent or limit the effects of cyber attacks or will be sufficient to prevent or detect, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems when such attacks do occur. If our systems for protecting against cyber attacks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, client data, our reputation, interruption of business operations, or additional costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyber attacks. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESCurrently, we have over 70 offices (totaling approximately 3.1 million square feet of space) in more than 50 countries. In these locations, we lease approximately 2.1 million square feet and own approximately 1.0 million square feet. We serve our worldwide clients through six Advanced Technology Centers ("ATCs") that are located in Aberdeen, Scotland; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Calgary, Canada; Houston, Texas; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESPrice Range of Common SharesOur common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange ("Euronext Amsterdam") under the symbol "CLB". On February 8, 2019, the closing price, as quoted by the NYSE, was $63.87 per share and there were 44,316,940 common shares issued and outstanding held by approximately 203 record holders. These amounts exclude shares held by us as treasury shares.See Part III, "Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters" for discussion of equity compensation plans. Performance GraphThe following performance graph compares the performance of our common shares to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Philadelphia Oil Service Index ("OSX") for the period beginning December 31, 2013 and ending December 31, 2018. Core Lab is now an established member of the OSX which includes a greater concentration of our most direct peers. The graph assumes that the value of the investment in our common shares and each index was $100 at December 31, 2013 and that all dividends were reinvested. The stockholder return set forth below is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The following graph and related information is "furnished" and shall not be deemed "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") except to the extent that Core Laboratories specifically incorporates it by reference into such filing.  15Share Repurchases in the Fourth Quarter of 2018 The following table provides information about our purchases of equity securities that are registered by us pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act during the three months ended December 31, 2018: 16In connection with our initial public offering in September 1995, our shareholders authorized our Management Board to repurchase up to 10% of our issued share capital, the maximum allowed under Dutch law at the time, for a period of 18 months. This authorization was renewed at subsequent annual or special shareholder meetings. At our annual shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2018, our shareholders authorized an extension until November 24, 2019 to purchase up to 10% of our issued share capital. The repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management pursuant to this shareholder authorization.From the activation of the share repurchase program through December 31, 2018, we have repurchased 39,618,299 shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion, or an average price of $41.57 per share. At December 31, 2018, we held 479,407 shares in treasury and have the authority to repurchase 4,000,218 additional shares under our stock repurchase program as described in the preceding paragraph.ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected consolidated financial information contained below is derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our audited Consolidated Financial Statements each of which is included in this Form 10-K. 17ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCore Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry, primarily through client relationships with many of the world's major, national and independent oil companies.We operate our business in two reporting segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields:General OverviewWe provide services as well as design and produce products which enable our clients to evaluate reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. These services and products are generally in higher demand when our clients are investing capital in their field development programs that are designed to increase productivity from existing fields or when exploring for new fields. Our clients' investment in capital expenditure programs tends to correlate over the longer term to oil and natural gas commodity prices. During periods of higher, stable prices, our clients generally invest more in capital expenditures and, during periods of lower or volatile commodity prices, they tend to invest less. Consequently, the level of capital expenditures by our clients impacts the demand for our services and products.The following table summarizes the annual average and year-end worldwide and U.S. rig counts for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as well as the annual average and year-end spot price of a barrel of WTI crude, Europe Brent crude and an MMBtu of natural gas:The prices for both WTI and Brent crude oil showed improvement during 2017 and continued to strengthen through most of 2018; however, they decreased significantly during the last quarter of 2018 to end the year at levels not seen since mid-2016.   18The improvement in crude oil prices over this two-year period led to elevated levels in U.S. onshore activities associated with both the exploration and production of oil; however, levels of activity outside the U.S. have remained relatively flat. In North America, the land-based rig count increased 45% during 2017 and another 19% during 2018, which had a positive impact for both services and product sales to this market over this time period. Although the North America rig count had improved by the end of 2018 it still remained almost 50% below 2014 levels. The build in levels of activities on development projects and producing fields in the U.S. unconventional reservoirs during 2017 continued to strengthen during most of 2018, until October 2018 when the commodity price weakened significantly and activity levels decreased.Outside of North America, activities associated with the exploration for and production of oil dropped to current lower levels during the industry downturn which began at the end of 2014 and remained relatively flat during 2017 and 2018. Our clients' activities in the international and deepwater markets remained at these lower levels in 2017 and 2018, and although activities have not yet increased, we believe these markets have shown signs of recovery for 2019 and beyond as our clients have announced new capital investment projects throughout 2017 and 2018.Results of OperationsOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 We evaluate our operating results by analyzing revenue, operating income and operating income margin (defined as operating income divided by total revenue). Since we have a relatively fixed cost structure, increases in revenue generally translate into higher operating income results. Results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the following chart:  19Results of operations as a percentage of applicable revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands, except for per share information):Services RevenueServices revenue, which is tied more to activities associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas outside the U.S., increased 1.4% to $486.8 million in 2018 from $480.3 million in 2017 which increased 2.5% from $468.4 million in 2016. The increase in revenue was driven by a stronger U.S. market for most of 2018, which was partially offset by a weaker market outside the U.S. Crude oil prices continued to strengthen throughout 2018 until early October when crude oil prices peaked and decreased over 40% by December 2018. The improvement in crude oil prices continued to support elevated activity levels in the U.S. onshore market for most of 2018, however activities outside the U.S. have remained flat. Although our clients have announced Final Investment Decisions ("FIDs") for several projects outside the U.S. and in offshore environments, significant activity on these projects did not start in 2018 and wells must be drilled and/or completed, stimulated, cored and have reservoir fluid samples collected, before we see a revenue opportunity. We continue our focus on worldwide crude oil related projects, including those related to the development of fields in onshore and offshore North America, offshore South America, offshore Europe and Africa, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific regions. Product Sales RevenueProduct sales revenue, which is tied more to the completion of wells in North America, increased 28% to $214.0 million in 2018 from $167.6 million in 2017 and increased 38% from $121.8 million in 2016. The 28% increase in product sales revenue  20in 2018 compared to 2017 outpaced the 13% increase in rig count and the 25% increase in the completion of wells due to our differentiated well completion product sales surpassing the industry activity levels in North America.Cost of Services, excluding depreciationCost of services increased to $343.8 million in 2018 compared to $333.4 million in 2017 and $329.5 million in 2016. As a percentage of services revenue, cost of services remained relatively flat at 71% in 2018, 69% in 2017 and 70% in 2016. Cost of services as a percentage of services revenue is primarily reflective of how our fixed cost structure is being absorbed by revenue. Cost of Product Sales, excluding depreciationCost of product sales increased to $153.1 million in 2018 from $131.6 million in 2017 and $108.0 million in 2016. As a percentage of product sales revenue, cost of sales improved to 72% for 2018 from 79% for 2017 and 89% for 2016. The improvement in cost of product sales as a percentage of sales revenue in 2018 was primarily due to the improved absorption rates of our fixed costs and investments in manufacturing automation.General and Administrative ExpenseGeneral and administrative ("G&A") expenses include corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operations. G&A expenses were $62.9 million in 2018 compared to $47.7 million and $39.4 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The variances are primarily due to changes in compensation expense during those periods, including additional stock compensation expense of $9.9 million in 2018 recorded for retirement eligible employees. See Note 14 , Stock-Based Compensation for further detail.Depreciation and Amortization ExpenseDepreciation and amortization expense of $23.1 million in 2018 is down compared to $24.5 million in 2017 and $26.3 million in 2016.Other (Income) Expense, netThe components of Other (income) expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):In 2018, we received settlement of a claim for business interruption and damages incurred as a result of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. 21Foreign exchange gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the following table (in thousands):Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased by $2.6 million to $13.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased average borrowings on our revolving Credit Facility which was used to fund an acquisition for $49.1 million in September 2018. Income Tax ExpenseOur effective tax rate was 24.2%, 18.4%, and 14.3% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Income tax expense of $25.4 million in 2018 increased by $7.2 million compared to $18.2 million in 2017 due to an increase in taxable income in 2018, primarily in the United States. Income tax expense associated with taxable income recognized in the United States increased by $4.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017. No other jurisdiction in which we operate had a material change in income tax expense.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA") was signed into law reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. During 2018, various proposed regulations have been released, providing guidance on identified issues and topics regarding the TCJA. The most impactful changes for the company from the TCJA are the deduction limitations for compensation paid to executive officers and the benefit from the foreign derived intangible income regime. See Note 10, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of income tax expense.Segment AnalysisThe following charts and tables summarize the annual revenue and operating results for our two complementary business segments.  22Segment RevenueSegment RevenueSegment Operating IncomeSegment Operating Income Margins (1)Reservoir DescriptionRevenue for our Reservoir Description segment decreased slightly to $413.1 million in 2018 compared to $415.2 million in 2017 and $426.2 million in 2016. The decreases in revenues in 2018 and 2017 as compared to each corresponding prior year were primarily due to the reduced international and deepwater project activity levels during 2017 and 2018. This segment's operations continue to work on large-scale, long-term, crude-oil and LNG projects with an emphasis on producing fields located in offshore developments and international markets. We continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in the Asia-Pacific areas, offshore Europe and Africa, offshore South America, North America, and the Middle East. 23Operating income decreased to $54.8 million in 2018 from $66.5 million in 2017 due to lower activity levels derived from large capital spending projects in international markets and additional stock compensation expense of $6.3 million in 2018 for retirement eligible employees. See Note 14 , Stock-Based Compensation for further detail. Operating income decreased to $66.5 million in 2017 from $78.9 million in 2016, primarily due to lower activity levels. Operating margins, excluding the additional stock compensation expense recorded in 2018 were comparable at 15% in 2018 and 16.0% in 2017 but down from 18.5% in 2016. Production EnhancementRevenue for our Production Enhancement segment increased to $287.8 million in 2018 compared to $232.6 million in 2017 and $164.0 million in 2016. The increase in onshore North America industry activity during 2018 and 2017 compared to each corresponding prior year resulted in increased demand for our products associated with land-based completion of oil wells in U.S. unconventional developments. Operating income for this segment increased to $63.0 million in 2018 from $44.0 million in 2017 primarily due to increased demand for our higher margin products and services and the impact of higher revenue on our fixed-cost structure offset by additional stock compensation expense of $3.7 million in 2018 for retirement eligible employees. See Note 14 , Stock-Based Compensation for further detail. Operating income for this segment increased to $44.0 million in 2017 from $8.5 million in 2016 primarily due to increased demand for our higher margin products and services and the impact of higher revenue on our fixed-cost structure. Operating margins were 21.9% in 2018 up from 18.9% in 2017 and 5.2% in 2016. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe have historically financed our activities through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities, equity financing and the issuance of debt. Cash flows from operating activities provide the primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and our dividend and share repurchase programs. If necessary, we supplement this cash flow with borrowings under bank credit facilities to finance some capital expenditures and business acquisitions. As we are a Netherlands holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. Our cash availability is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us and on the terms and conditions of our existing and future credit arrangements. There are no restrictions preventing any of our subsidiaries from repatriating earnings, and there are no restrictions or income taxes associated with distributing cash to the parent company through loans or advances. As of December 31, 2018, $12.6 million of our $13.1 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries, including the U.S.Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP"). We utilize the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash paid for capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and operating activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating profit, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for distribution because we may have other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Moreover, since free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, free cash flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The following table reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):  24Free cash flow as a percent of income from continuing operations of 113.3% continued to be strong in 2018. The decrease in free cash flow in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increases in both working capital and capital expenditures in 2018 as the activity levels in the oil industry improved. The decrease in free cash flow in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in both working capital and capital expenditures in 2017 as the activity levels in the oil industry improved.Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): The decreases in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in working capital and changes in net income as the activity levels in the oil industry improved. Working capital was impacted by the increase in inventories during 2018 which was due to more raw materials and finished goods being held in our distribution network to support the anticipated growth in product sales.Cash used in investing activities in 2018 increased $50.1 million compared to 2017 primarily as a result of an acquisition for $49.1 million in 2018 as well as increased capital expenditures in 2018 as activity levels in the oil industry improved. Cash used in investing activities in 2017 increased $5.8 million compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased capital expenditures.Cash used in financing activities in 2018 decreased $61.6 million compared to 2017. Cash used in financing activities in 2017 decreased $20.8 million compared to 2016. During 2018, we used $7.5 million to repurchase our common shares, $97.3 million to pay dividends, and increased our debt balance by $64 million. During 2017, we used $16.9 million to repurchase our common shares, $97.1 million to pay dividends, and increased our debt balance by $10 million. During 2016, we used $7.2 million to repurchase our common shares, $95.1 million to pay dividends, and decreased our debt balance by $215 million through the issuance of new shares.During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 85,985 shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $7.5 million, or an average price of $86.66 per share. The repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management pursuant to shareholder authorization. We regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to fund restricted shares that vest or to finance future acquisitions. Under Dutch law and subject to certain Dutch statutory provisions and shareholder approval, we can hold a maximum of 50% of our issued shares in treasury. We currently have shareholder approval to hold 10% of our issued share capital in treasury. On May 24, 2018 at our annual shareholders meeting, our shareholders authorized the extension of our share repurchase program until November 24, 2019 to purchase up to 10% of our issued share capital. We believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders. Our share price has increased from $4.03 per share in 2002, when we began to repurchase shares, to $59.66 per share on December 31, 2018, an increase of over 1,380%.Credit Facility and Available Future Liquidity In 2011, we issued two series of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $150 million ("Senior Notes") in a private placement transaction. Series A consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.01% and are due in full on September 30, 2021. Series B consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.11% and are due in full on September 30, 2023. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30.On June 18, 2018, we entered into an agreement to amend our revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). To appropriately size the facility, the aggregate borrowing commitment was reduced from $400 million to $300 million. The Credit Facility provides an option to increase the commitment under the Credit Facility by an additional $100 million to bring the total borrowings available to $400 million if certain prescribed conditions are met by the Company. The Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus 1.375% to a maximum of LIBOR plus 2.0%.  25Any outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due June 19, 2023, when the Credit Facility matures. Interest payment terms are variable depending upon the specific type of borrowing under this facility. Our available capacity at any point in time is subject to all terms of the agreements, and is reduced by borrowings outstanding at the time and outstanding letters of credit which totaled $18.0 million at December 31, 2018, resulting in an available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of $140.0 million. In addition to those items under the Credit Facility, we had $13.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds from other sources as of December 31, 2018.The terms of the Credit Facility and Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in each agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters. The Credit Facility has the more restrictive covenants with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.5 to 1.0. We believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants contained in our credit agreements. Certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co-borrowers under the Credit Facility and Senior Notes.In 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of $25 million, we fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 1.73% through August 29, 2019, and under the second swap agreement of $25 million, we fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.50% through August 29, 2024. Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are highly effective. Unrealized gains and losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in income as an increase or decrease to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense.In addition to our repayment commitments under our Credit Facility and our Senior Notes, we have non-cancellable operating lease arrangements under which we lease property including land, buildings, office equipment and vehicles.The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations under these arrangements (in thousands):We have no significant purchase commitments or similar obligations outstanding at December 31, 2018. Not included in the table above are uncertain tax positions of $7.5 million that we have accrued for at December 31, 2018, as the amounts and timing of payment, if any, are uncertain. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of this amount.At December 31, 2018, we had tax net operating loss carry-forwards in various jurisdictions of $25.8 million. Although we cannot be certain that these operating loss carry-forwards will be utilized, we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry-forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018. If unused, those carry-forwards which are subject to expiration may expire during the years 2018-2028. During 2018, less than $0.1 million of net operating loss carry-forwards which carried a full valuation allowance expired unused.We expect our investment in capital expenditures to track client demand for our services and products. Given the improving, but still uncertain, trend in industry activity levels, we have not determined, at this time, the level of investment that will be made in 2019. We will, however, continue to invest to fund the purchase of instrumentation, tools and equipment along with expenditures to replace obsolete or worn-out instrumentation, tools and equipment, to consolidate certain facilities to gain operational efficiencies, and to increase our presence where requested by our clients. In addition, we plan to continue to (i)  26repurchase our common shares on the open market through our share repurchase program, (ii) pay a dividend and (iii) if available, in the market at acceptable valuations, acquire complementary technologies. Our ability to continue these initiatives depends on, among other things, market conditions and our ability to generate free cash flow.Our ability to maintain and increase our operating income and cash flows is largely dependent upon continued investing activities. We are a Netherlands holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted through subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us. We believe our future cash flows from operating activities, supplemented by our borrowing capacity under existing facilities and our ability to issue additional equity should be sufficient to meet our contractual obligations, capital expenditures, working capital needs, dividend payments, debt requirements and to finance future acquisitions.OutlookAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening or expanding facilities in strategic areas and realizing synergies within our business lines subject to client demand and market conditions. We believe our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service clients who have global operations whether they are international oil companies, national oil companies, or independent oil companies.We are encouraged by the increased focus of our major clients regarding capital management, return on invested capital (“ROIC”), free cash flow, and returning capital back to their shareholders, as opposed to a focus on production growth at any cost. The companies adopting value versus volume metrics tend to be the more technologically sophisticated operators and form the foundation of Core Lab’s worldwide client base. We expect to benefit from our clients’ shift in focus from strictly production growth to employing higher technological solutions in their efforts to maximize economic production growth and estimated ultimate recovery ("EUR"). During the fourth quarter 2018, the worldwide crude-oil market added supply, likely in anticipation of the proposed Iran sanctions. Consequently, during November and December the per-barrel price of crude oil fell by more than 40% from the year’s peak in October 2018. However, global crude-oil inventories exited 2018 at approximately 38 days of consumption, consistent with a multi-year trend of declining global crude-oil inventories related to demand. The International Energy Agency's ("IEA") most recent estimated worldwide demand projections remain strong with 1,400,000 additional barrels of oil per day needed in 2019. After five years of muted investment in international, offshore and deepwater projects, oil companies announced more than 30 FIDs in 2018, an increase of more than 20% from 2017. The renewed investment at a global level is critical in order to meet future supply needs. Recognition of the need for investment is evidenced by the FIDs announced over the last two years and Wood McKenzie's estimation of another 30 upstream projects for 2019. However, Core Lab anticipates a slowing in further project announcements until confidence in the balance of global crude-oil markets is restored. We believe there will be a positive correction to the temporary oversupply of crude oil by the end of the first quarter 2019, which should encourage additional FID projects to be announced in 2019.We continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluid characterization studies in the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, offshore Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, along with Guyana, Malaysia and other international locations such as offshore South America, and the Middle East. We also focus on complex completions in unconventional tight-oil reservoirs, technological solutions and services for increasing daily productions and EURs.As customary, Core Lab expects typical sequential seasonal industry patterns will cause the first quarter of 2019 to be down, and international field development spending will be funded largely from operating budgets.  International recovery on a more broad-based scope is expected to improve as 2019 unfolds.  Reservoir Description continues to discuss international projects with clients, which are in alignment with FIDs previously announced. The revenue opportunity for Reservoir Description occurs once the well has been drilled and core and fluid samples are taken and analyzed.  Activity levels and revenue opportunities from these FIDs and the emerging international recovery are expected to have a positive impact on financial performance in 2019.  The average first quarter 2019 U.S. rig count is projected to be flat to modestly down sequentially, with U.S. completion activity to remain at similar levels exiting 2018, until transitory logistical bottlenecks are addressed (e.g. supply chain logistics and take-away restrictions are resolved in the Permian Basin of West Texas). These logistical bottlenecks are anticipated to be resolved in the second half of 2019. In addition, an emerging trend to larger pad drilling sites, increasing from six to eight wells up to 24 wells, will create an increase in drilled but uncompleted wells over the next several quarters. Combined, these issues could impact the rate of revenue growth opportunity for any company that is reliant on completions as a catalyst for growth.  27The drilled-but-uncompleted well inventory levels continue to rise and are in excess of moderated inventory levels for current activity levels. These uncompleted wells should provide Core Lab with future revenue opportunities. Reservoir Description continues to discuss international projects with clients which are in alignment with FIDs previously announced. Activity levels and revenue opportunities from FIDs and the emerging international recovery are expected to have a positive impact on financial performance in 2019. The revenue opportunity for Reservoir Description occurs once the well has been drilled and core and fluid samples are taken and analyzed.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and determine the adequacy of our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. By nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The following transaction types require significant judgment and, therefore, are considered critical accounting policies as of December 31, 2018. Income TaxesOur income tax expense includes income taxes of the Netherlands, the U.S. and other foreign countries as well as local, state and provincial income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled. We estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets (particularly, net operating loss carry-forwards). Any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Valuation allowances of our net deferred tax assets aggregated to $9.7 million and $8.2 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested. Should we make a distribution of the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, we may be required to record additional taxes. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return. We also recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.Long-Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. They are depreciated using the straight-line method based on their individual estimated useful lives, except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the remaining lease term, if shorter. We estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets based on historical data of similar assets. When long-lived assets are sold or retired, the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income. These capitalized long-lived assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes.Intangible assets, including patents, trademarks, and trade names, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangibles with determinable lives are amortized using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the intangible. Intangibles with indeterminable lives, which consist primarily of corporate trade names, are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. We review our long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recovered over their remaining service lives. Indicators of possible impairment may include significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located, extended periods of idle use, declining revenue or cash flow or overall changes in general market conditions. 28Whenever possible impairment is indicated, we compare the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from use, plus salvage value, less the costs of the subsequent disposition of the assets. If impairment is still indicated, we compare the fair value of the assets to the carrying amount, and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. We did not record any material impairment charges relating to our long-lived assets held for use during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.We record goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units, which are our reportable segments, to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted future cash flow analysis. Estimated future cash flows were based on the company's best estimate of future performance. Our impairment analysis is quantitative; however, it includes subjective estimates based on assumptions regarding future growth rates, interest rates and operating expenses. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value determined, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We did not record impairment charges relating to our goodwill or our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.We have never identified nor recorded any impairments relating to the goodwill of our current continuing operations.Pensions and Other Postretirement BenefitsWe maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of our Dutch employees hired before 2000. We utilize an actuary to assist in determining the value of the projected benefit obligation. This valuation requires various estimates and assumptions concerning mortality, future pay increases, expected return on plan assets and discount rate used to value our obligations. We recognize net periodic benefit cost based upon these estimates. As required by current accounting standards, we recognize net periodic pension costs associated with this plan in income from current operations and recognize the unfunded status of the plan, if any, as a long-term liability. In addition, we recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic pension cost. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Furthermore, we sponsor several defined contribution plans for the benefit of our employees. We expense these contributions in the period the contribution is made. Stock-Based CompensationWe have two stock-based compensation plans, as described in further detail in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate the probability that certain of our stock-based plans will meet targets established within the respective agreements and result in the vesting of such awards. For new awards issued and awards modified, repurchased or canceled, the compensation expense is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for those awards over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value is determined by calculating the share price on the date of grant less the discounted value of the expected dividends to be paid over the vesting period.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOther than normal operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements such as securitization agreements, liquidity trust vehicles, synthetic leases or special purpose entities. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.Forward-Looking StatementsThis Form 10-K and the documents incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These "forward-looking statements" are based on an analysis of currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain and investors should recognize that events and actual results could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations. By way of illustration, when used in this document, words such as "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "intend", "estimate", "project", "will", "should", "could", "may", "predict" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in  29forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us or our management, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us and the industry in which we operate, including, among other things:Our businesses depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil, which could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.The above description of risks and uncertainties is by no means all-inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider. For a more detailed description of risk factors, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K and our reports and registration statements filed from time to time with the SEC.All forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date of this Form 10-K. We do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements that we may make in this Form 10-K or other documents, reports, filings or press releases, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Pronouncements Adopted in 2018In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 ("Revenue from Contracts with Customers"), which provides guidance on revenue recognition. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance requires entities to apply a five-step method to (1) identify the contract(s) with customers; (2) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We adopted this standard and related amendments on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not result in any material changes to our revenue recognition policies and procedures nor to our financial statements. Upon adoption, we used the modified retrospective approach; this approach resulted in no cumulative adjustment to retained earnings or net income and no adjustments to prior periods.In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 ("Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost"), which requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2018. We used the practical expedient method which allows us to use the amounts disclosed in our pension footnote for the year ended December 31, 2017 as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirement. The adoption of this standard did not result in any material changes to our consolidated financial statements. 30Pronouncements Not Yet EffectiveIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ("Leases"), which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 ("Targeted Improvements to Leases"), which provides companies with an additional transition method that allows the effects of the adoption of the new standard to be recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We have evaluated and elected this optional transition method for adoption. Based on our current lease portfolio, we estimate that the adoption of this standard will result in approximately $77 million of additional assets and liabilities being reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption of this standard on January 1, 2019; however, there will not be a material impact to our Consolidated Statement of Operations or Cash Flows.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 ("Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments") which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 ("Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"), which provides companies with an option to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted, and would be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the tax rate as a result of the TCJA is recognized. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket RiskWe are exposed to market risk, which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates. We do not believe that our exposure to market risks, which are primarily related to interest rate changes, is material.Interest Rate RiskWe maintain certain debt instruments at a fixed rate whose fair value will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and market perception of our credit risk. The fair value of our debt at December 31, 2018 and 2017 approximated the book value.In 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 1.73% through August 29, 2019, and under the second swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.50% through August 29, 2024. Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or a liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are highly effective. Unrealized gains and losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in income as an increase or decrease to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense.From time to time, we are exposed to interest rate risk on our Credit Facility debt for amounts outstanding in excess of $50 million, which carries a variable interest rate. At December 31, 2018, we had an outstanding balance of $142 million. A 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.Foreign Currency Risk 31We operate in a number of international areas which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We do not currently hold or issue forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes (a foreign exchange contract is an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate). Foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar ("USD") against foreign currencies and are included in other (income) expense in the statements of operations. We recognized foreign exchange losses in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency, as well as in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency. We recognized foreign exchange gains in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency, as well as in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency. Credit RiskOur financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Substantially all cash and cash equivalents are on deposit at commercial banks or investment firms. Our trade receivables are with a variety of domestic, international and national oil and gas companies. Management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the creditworthiness and financial resources of these financial institutions and companies.ITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURENone.ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018 at the reasonable assurance level.Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Further, the design of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  32Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control − Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment using these criteria, our management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by KPMG, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 11, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion./s/ KPMG LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015.Houston, TexasFebruary 11, 2019Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and Board of DirectorsCore Laboratories N.V.:Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Core Laboratories N.V. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and financial statement schedules II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 11, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A of Core Laboratories N.V.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ KPMG LLPHouston, TexasFebruary 11, 2019F-2CORE LABORATORIES N.V.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSDecember 31, 2018 and 2017(In thousands, except share and per share data)The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.F-3CORE LABORATORIES N.V.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONSFor the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (In thousands, except per share data)The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.F-4CORE LABORATORIES N.V.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEFor the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (In thousands)The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.F-5CORE LABORATORIES N.V.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITYFor the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (In thousands, except share data)The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.F-6CORE LABORATORIES N.V.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWSFor the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (In thousands)The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.F-7CORE LABORATORIES N.V.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (Continued)For the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (In thousands)The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.F-8CORE LABORATORIES N.V.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBER 31, 2018 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Core Laboratories N.V. ("Core Laboratories", "Core Lab", "the Company", "we", "our" or "us") is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry. These services and products can enable our clients to improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from their producing fields. We have over 70 offices in more than 50 countries and have approximately 4,700 employees.We operate our business in two reporting segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields:  (1) Reservoir Description and (2) Production Enhancement. For a description of product types and services offered by these business segments, see Note 19 - Segment Reporting. In the first quarter of 2018, in a continuing effort to streamline our business and align our business strategy for further integration of services and products, the Company committed to divest the business of our full range of permanent downhole monitoring systems and related services, which had been part of our Production Enhancement segment.  All prior period income statements have been adjusted to reclassify amounts related to this business to discontinued operations to conform to current period presentation. All disclosures on operating income and net income within these statements reflect the results from continuing operations for all periods presented. These reclassifications had no impact on the reported net income attributable to Core Laboratories N.V., financial position or cash flows for any of these prior periods.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of Consolidation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP"), and include the accounts of Core Laboratories and its subsidiaries for which we have a controlling voting interest and/or a controlling financial interest. The equity method of accounting is used to record our interest in investments in which we have less than a majority interest and do not exercise control but do exert significant influence. We use the cost method to record certain other investments in which we own less than 20% of the outstanding equity and do not exercise control or exert significant influence. We record non-controlling interest associated with consolidated subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and utilize our historical experience, as well as various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in a given circumstance, in order to make these estimates. Actual results could differ from our estimates, as assumptions and conditions change.The following accounts, among others, require us to use estimates and assumptions: F-9Accounting policies relating to these accounts and the nature of these estimates are further discussed under the applicable caption. For each of these critical estimates it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates will occur in the short term which may impact our financial position or results of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all short-term, highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. These items are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.Concentration of Credit RiskOur financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk relate primarily to cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. All cash and cash equivalents are on deposit at commercial banks or investment firms with significant financial resources. Our trade receivables are with a variety of domestic, international and national oil and gas companies. We had no clients who provided more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We consider our credit risk related to trade accounts receivable to be limited due to the creditworthiness and financial resources of our clients. We evaluate our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts on an on-going basis throughout the year. Concentration of Interest Rate RiskWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") debt, which carries a variable interest rate. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our Senior Notes which carry a fixed interest rate, but whose fair value will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and market perception of our credit risk.Derivative InstrumentsWe may enter into a variety of derivative instruments in connection with the management of our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates. See Note 15 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.We do not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.Accounts ReceivableTrade accounts receivable are recorded at their invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and monitor collections and payments in order to maintain a provision for estimated uncollectible accounts based on our historical collection experience and our current aging of client receivables outstanding, in addition to client's representations and our understanding of the economic environment in which our clients operate. Based on our review we establish or adjust allowances for specific clients and the accounts receivable as a whole, and recognize expense. When an account is determined to be uncollectible, we charge the receivable to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $2.7 million and $2.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net carrying value of accounts receivable is considered to be representative of its respective fair value.Inventories Inventories consist of manufactured goods, materials and supplies used for sales or services to clients. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Inventory costs are recorded at standard cost which approximates the first-in, first-out method.Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets are comprised primarily of prepaid insurance, value added taxes and prepaid rents.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. They are depreciated using the straight-line method based on their individual estimated useful lives, except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the F-10remaining lease term, if shorter. We estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets based on historical data as follows:When long-lived assets are sold or retired, the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income. These capitalized long-lived assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes. We review our long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recovered over their remaining service lives. Indicators of possible impairment may include significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located, extended periods of idle use, declining revenue or cash flow or overall changes in general market conditions.Whenever possible impairment is indicated, we compare the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from use, plus salvage value, less the costs of the subsequent disposition of the assets. If impairment is still indicated, we compare the fair value of the assets to the carrying amount, and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. We did not record any material impairment charges relating to our long-lived assets held for use during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.Intangibles and Goodwill Intangible assets, including patents, trademarks, and trade names, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangibles with determinable lives are amortized using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the intangible. Intangibles with indeterminable lives, which consist primarily of corporate trade names, are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. We record goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units, which are our reportable segments, to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted future cash flow analysis. Estimated future cash flows were based on the Company's best estimate of future performance. Our impairment analysis is quantitative; however, it includes subjective estimates based on assumptions regarding future growth rates, interest rates and operating expenses. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value determined, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Any subsequent impairment loss could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations. We did not record impairment charges relating to our goodwill or our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.We have never identified nor recorded any impairments relating to the goodwill of our current continuing operations.Other AssetsCash surrender value of life insurance relates to postretirement benefit plans. See Note 11 - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Investments include unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method where the operations of these entities are in-line with those of our core businesses. These entities are not considered special purpose entities nor do we have special off-balance sheet arrangements through these entities. Other assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following (in thousands):F-11Accounts PayableTrade accounts payable are recorded at their invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The carrying value of accounts payable is considered to be representative of its respective fair value.Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled. We include interest and penalties from tax judgments in income tax expense.We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return. We also recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. See Note 10 - Income Taxes.Comprehensive IncomeComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other charges or credits to equity that are not the result of transactions with owners. Other comprehensive income consists of prior service costs and an unrecognized net actuarial gain and loss from a pension plan and changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps. See Note 11 - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans and Note 15 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.Revenue RecognitionAll of our revenue is derived from contracts with clients and is reported as revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our contracts generally include standard commercial payment terms generally acceptable in each region, and do not include financing with extended payment terms. We have no significant obligations for refunds, warranties, or similar obligations. Our revenue does not include taxes collected from our customers. In certain circumstances we apply the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 - Revenue From Contracts with Customers ("Topic 606") to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics. We use estimates and assumptions when accounting for a portfolio that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio of contracts.A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct service or good to a client, and is the unit of account under Topic 606. We have contracts with two general groups of performance obligations: those that require us to perform analysis and/or diagnostic tests in our laboratory or at the client's wellsite and those from the sale of tools, diagnostic and equipment products and related services. We recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services or goods as described below by applying the five-step method to:  (1) identify the contract(s) with clients; (2) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation(s).Services Revenue: We provide a variety of services to clients in the oil and gas industry. Where services are provided related to the testing and analysis of rock and fluids, we recognize revenue upon the provision of the test results or analysis to the client. For our design, field engineering and completion diagnostic services, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of those services at the well site or delivery of diagnostic data. In the case of our consortia studies, we have multiple performance obligations and revenue is recognized at the point in time when the testing and analysis results on each contributed core are made available to our consortia members. We conduct testing and provide analysis services in support of our consortia studies recognizing revenue as the testing and analysis results are made available to our consortia members.Product Sales Revenue: We manufacture equipment that we sell to our clients in the oil and gas industry. Revenue is recognized when title to that equipment passes to the client, which is typically when the product is shipped to the client or picked up by the client at our facilities, as set out in the contract. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on estimates of the price that we would charge the client for each promised service or product if it were sold on a standalone basis.F-12To a lesser extent in all of our business segments, we enter into other types of contracts including service arrangements and non-subscription software and licensing agreements. We recognize revenue for these arrangements over time or at a point in time depending on our evaluation of when the client obtains control of the promised services or products. Prior to our adoption of Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018, we recognized revenue when we determined the following criteria were met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The adoption of Topic 606 did not result in any material changes to our revenue recognition policies nor to our consolidated financial statements.Contract Assets and LiabilitiesContract assets and liabilities result due to the timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. Contract assets include our right to payment for goods and services already transferred to a customer when the right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time, for example contracts where we recognize revenue over time but do not have a contractual right to payment until we complete the performance obligations. Contract assets are included in our accounts receivable and are not material as of December 31, 2018. Contract liabilities consist of advance payments received and billings in excess of revenue recognized. We generally receive up-front payments relating to our consortia studies; we recognize revenue over the life of the study as the testing and analysis results are made available to our consortia members. We record billings in excess of revenue recognized for contracts with a duration less than twelve months as unearned revenue. We classify contract liabilities for contracts with a duration greater than twelve months as current or non-current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue. The current portion of contract liabilities is included in unearned revenue and the non-current portion of contract liabilities is included in long-term contract liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The total balance of our contract liabilities at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $7.4 million and $6.7 million, respectively.Disaggregation of RevenueWe contract with clients for service revenue and/or product sales revenue. We present revenue disaggregated by services and product sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For revenue disaggregated by reportable segment, see Note 19 -  Segment Reporting. Foreign Currencies Our functional currency is the U.S. Dollar ("USD"). All inter-company financing, transactions and cash flows of our subsidiaries are transacted in USD. Our foreign entities remeasure monetary assets and liabilities to USD at year-end exchange rates, while non-monetary items are measured at historical rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at the applicable month-end rate, except for depreciation, amortization and certain components of cost of sales, which are measured at historical rates. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred net remeasurement losses of $2.6 million, $1.0 million, and $1.8 million, respectively. These amounts were included in Other (Income) Expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.Pensions and Other Postretirement BenefitsWe provide a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our Dutch employees ("Dutch Plan") who were hired prior to 2007. As required by current accounting standards, we recognize net periodic pension costs associated with the Dutch plan in income from current operations and recognize the unfunded status of the plan, if any, as a long-term liability. In addition, we recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic pension cost. The projection of benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets requires the use of assumptions and estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 11 - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Furthermore, we maintain defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees primarily in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. We expense these contributions in the period the contribution is made. F-13Non-controlling InterestsWe maintain non-controlling interests in several investment ventures and disclose such interests clearly as a portion of equity separate from the parent's equity. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to these non-controlling interests is also clearly presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value and recorded as a gain or loss. Stock-Based Compensation We have two stock-based compensation plans, as described in further detail in Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation. For new awards issued and awards modified, repurchased or canceled, the compensation expense is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for those awards earned over the requisite service period of the award. Earnings Per Share We compute basic earnings per common share by dividing net income attributable to Core Laboratories N.V. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common and potential common share include additional shares in the weighted average share calculations associated with the incremental effect of dilutive restricted stock awards and contingently issuable shares, as determined using the treasury stock method. The following table summarizes the calculation of weighted average common shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 3. CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The balance of contract assets and contract liabilities consisted of the following at December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):We did not recognize any impairment losses on our receivables and contract assets for the year ended December 31, 2018.F-144. ACQUISITIONS In September 2018, we acquired Guardian Global Technologies Ltd., a business providing downhole technologies associated with perforating systems for $49.1 million in cash. These downhole technologies will significantly enhance Core Lab's Production Enhancement operations and its ability to bring new and innovative product offerings to our clients. We have estimated the fair values of tangible assets acquired to be $4.2 million, and intangible assets, including patents, customer-relationship benefits, non-compete agreements and trade secrets to be $3.6 million. We have accounted for this acquisition by allocating the purchase price to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition which resulted in an increase to goodwill of $41.3 million. We have not finalized the assessment of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; estimates of certain assets and liabilities require significant judgments and assumptions, and our estimates of acquisition date fair value will be determined upon finalization of our analysis. The fair value estimates are subject to adjustment during the measurement period subsequent to the acquisition date, not to exceed one year. The acquisition is included in the Production Enhancement business segment.Acquisition-related costs totaling $0.7 million that were incurred and expensed in the third quarter of 2018 are included in Other (income) expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs consisted of various advisory fees, and other direct incremental costs.The acquisition of this business did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Operations. We had no significant acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.5. INVENTORIESInventories consisted of the following at December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands): We include freight costs incurred for shipping inventory to our clients in the Cost of product sales caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 6. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET The components of property, plant and equipment, net were as follows at December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):7. INTANGIBLES, NET The components of intangibles, net as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in thousands): F-15Our estimated amortization expense relating to these intangibles for the next five years is summarized in the following table (in thousands):8. GOODWILL The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands):9. LONG-TERM DEBT, NET We have no capital lease obligations. Debt at December 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized in the following table (in thousands): In 2011, we issued two series of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $150 million ("Senior Notes") in a private placement transaction. Series A consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.01% and are due in full on September 30, 2021. Series B consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.11% and are due in full on September 30, 2023. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30.On June 19, 2018, we entered into an agreement to amend our revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). To appropriately size the facility, the aggregate borrowing commitment was reduced from $400 million to $300 million. The Credit Facility provides an option to increase the commitment under the Credit Facility by an additional $100 million to bring the total F-16borrowings available to $400 million if certain prescribed conditions are met by the Company. The Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus 1.375% to a maximum of LIBOR plus 2%. Any outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due June 19, 2023, when the Credit Facility matures. Interest payment terms are variable depending upon the specific type of borrowing under this facility. Our available capacity at any point in time is subject to all terms of the agreements, and is reduced by borrowings outstanding at the time and outstanding letters of credit which totaled $18.0 million at December 31, 2018, resulting in an available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of $140.0 million. In addition to those items under the Credit Facility, we had $13.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds from other sources as of December 31, 2018.The terms of the Credit Facility and Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in each agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters. The Credit Facility has the more restrictive covenants with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.5 to 1.0. We believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants contained in our credit agreements. Certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co-borrowers under the Credit Facility and Senior Notes.In 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge changes in the variable interest rate on our LIBOR-priced debt. See Note 15 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for discussion of our derivative instruments.The estimated fair value of total debt at December 31, 2018 and 2017 approximated the book value of total debt. The fair value was estimated using Level 2 inputs by calculating the sum of the discounted future interest and principal payments through the date of maturity.10. INCOME TAXES The components of income before income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands):The components of income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands):The differences in income tax expense computed using the Netherlands statutory income tax rate of 25% in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and our income tax expense as reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands):F-17Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from various temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized as follows (in thousands):On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA") was signed into law reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. During 2018, various proposed regulations were released, providing guidance on identified issues and topics regarding the TCJA. The most impactful changes for the company from the TCJA are F-18the deduction limitations for compensation paid to executive officers and the benefit from the foreign derived intangible income regime. We have not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested. Should we make a distribution of the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, we may be required to record additional taxes. As of December 31, 2018, we consider $237.5 million to be indefinitely reinvested. Repatriation of these earnings would be subject to income and withholding taxes estimated at $25.3 million. There are no restrictions preventing any of our subsidiaries from repatriating earnings, and there are no restrictions or income taxes associated with distributing cash to the parent company through loans or advances.At December 31, 2018, we had tax net operating loss carry-forwards in various tax jurisdictions of $25.8 million. Although we cannot be certain that these operating loss carry-forwards will be utilized, we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry-forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2018, if unused, $2.0 million will expire between 2019-2021, $4.6 million will expire between 2022-2024, $13.4 million will expire between 2025-2028 and $0.4 million will expire beyond 2028. The remaining balance of $5.4 million is not subject to expiration. During 2018, less than $0.1 million of net operating loss carry-forwards, which carried a full valuation allowance, expired unused. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently undergoing multiple examinations in various jurisdictions, and the years 2001 through 2017 remain open for examination in various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The ultimate settlement and timing of these additional tax assessments is uncertain but the Company will continue to vigorously defend its return filing position and does not view the assessments as probable at this time.During 2018, adjustments were made to estimates for uncertain tax positions in certain tax jurisdictions based upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a reduction to the unrecognized tax benefits. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):Changes in our estimate of, or the recognition of, the unrecognized tax benefits shown in the table above would affect our effective tax rate. Our policy is to record accrued interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, net of any tax effect, as part of total tax expense for the period. The corresponding liability is carried along with the tax exposure as a non-current payable in Other Long-term Liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $0.6 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had $3.9 million, $3.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. Changes in our estimate of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 there are $0.6 million, $1.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that could be resolved within the next twelve months which could have a positive effect on the annual effective tax rate.11. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Defined Benefit PlanWe provide a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our Dutch employees ("Dutch Plan") who were hired prior to 2000. This pension benefit is based on years of service and final pay. The benefits earned by the employees are immediately vested. We fund the future obligations of the Dutch Plan by purchasing an insurance contract from a large multi-national insurance company with a five-year maturity. Each year we make annual premium payments to the insurance company (1) to provide for the benefit obligation of the current year of service based on each employee's age, gender F-19and current salary, and (2) for the changes in the benefit obligation for prior years of service due to changes in participants' salary. We determine the fair value of these plan assets with the assistance of an actuary using observable inputs (Level 2), which approximates the contract value of the investments. During the year, there was a curtailment of the Dutch Plan for our Dutch employees hired between 2000 and 2007 whose pension benefit was based on years of service and career average pay. These employees have been moved into the Dutch defined contribution plan. However, the unconditional indexation for this group of participants remains as long as they stay in active service for the company. This event resulted in a curtailment gain of $1.2 million as of December 31, 2018.The following table summarizes the change in the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for the Dutch Plan for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):The following actuarial assumptions were used to determine the actuarial present value of our projected benefit obligation and the net periodic pension costs for the Dutch Plan at December 31, 2018 and 2017:The discount rate used to determine our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2018 was decreased from 2.00% to 1.75%, consistent with a general decrease in interest rates in Europe for AAA-rated long-term Euro government bonds.Amounts recognized for the Dutch Plan in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 consist of (in thousands):F-20The components of net periodic pension cost for the Dutch Plan under this plan for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 included (in thousands):Plan assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of insurance contracts with returns equal to the contractual rate, which are comparable with governmental debt securities. Our expected long-term rate of return assumptions are based on the weighted-average contractual rates for each contract. Dutch law dictates the minimum requirements for pension funding. Our goal is to meet these minimum funding requirements, while our insurance carrier invests to minimize risks associated with future benefit payments.Our 2019 minimum funding requirements are expected to be $0.8 million. Our estimate of future annual contributions is based on current funding requirements, and we believe these contributions will be sufficient to fund the plan. Expected benefit payments to eligible participants under this plan for the next five years are as follows (in thousands):Defined Contribution PlansWe maintain defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees primarily in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In accordance with the terms of each plan, we and our participating employees contribute up to specified limits and under certain plans, we may make discretionary contributions in accordance with the defined contribution plans. Our primary obligation under these defined contribution plans is limited to paying the annual contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid $4.3 million, $4.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for our contributions and our additional discretionary contributions to the defined contribution plans.Vesting in all employer contributions is accelerated upon the death of the participant or a change in control. Employer contributions under the plans are forfeited upon a participant’s termination of employment to the extent they are not vested at that time. Deferred Compensation ArrangementsWe have entered into deferred compensation contracts for certain key employees to provide additional retirement income to the participants. The benefit is determined by the contract for either a fixed amount or by a calculation using years of service or age at retirement along with the average of their base salary for the five years prior to retirement. We are not required to fund this arrangement; however, we have purchased life insurance policies with cash surrender values to assist us in providing the benefits pursuant to these deferred compensation contracts with the actual benefit payments made by Core Laboratories. The F-21charge to expense for these deferred compensation contracts in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively.We provide severance compensation to certain current key employees if employment is terminated under certain circumstances, such as following a change in control or for any reason other than upon their death or disability, for “cause” or upon a material breach of a material provision of their employment agreement, as defined in their employment agreements. In addition, there are certain countries where we are legally required to make severance payments to employees when they leave our service. We have accrued for all of these severance payments, but they are not funded. We have also adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (“Deferred Compensation Plan”) that allows certain highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their salary, commission and bonus, as well as the amount of any reductions in their deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan for employees in the United States, due to certain limitations imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Contributions to the plan are invested in equity and other investment fund assets, and carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The benefits under these contracts are fully vested. Our primary obligation for the Deferred Compensation Plan is limited to our annual contributions. Employer contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $0.1 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million, respectively.Vesting in all employer contributions is accelerated upon the death of the participant or a change in control. Employer contributions under the plans are forfeited upon a participant's termination of employment to the extent they are not vested at that time.12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These include, but are not limited to, employment-related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with the provision of our services and products. A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. In 1998, we entered into employment agreements with our three senior executive officers that provide for deferred compensation benefits. The present value of the long-term liability recorded and fully reserved for the benefits due upon severing the employment of these employees is $9.0 million at December 31, 2018. Two of these executive officers retired from the Company on December 31, 2018 and the payment of these deferred compensation benefits will begin for both retired participants in 2019.We do not maintain any off-balance sheet debt or other similar financing arrangements nor have we formed any special purpose entities for the purpose of maintaining off-balance sheet debt.Scheduled minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases at December 31, 2018, consist of the following (in thousands):Operating lease commitments relate primarily to rental of equipment and office space. Rental expense for operating leases, including amounts for short-term leases with nominal future rental commitments, was $20.8 million, $20.9 million and $20.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ("Leases"), which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  In addition, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 ("Targeted Improvements to Leases"), which provides companies with an additional transition method that allows the effects of the adoption of the new standard to be recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. This new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods F-22within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We have evaluated and elected this optional transition method for adoption. Based on our current lease portfolio, we estimate that the adoption of this standard will result in approximately $77 million of additional assets and liabilities being reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption of this standard on January 1, 2019; however, there will not be a material impact to our Consolidated Statement of Operations or Cash Flows.13. EQUITY Common SharesIn 2016, we completed a public offering of 1,475,000 shares of our common stock. The purchase price paid by the underwriter was $116.67 per share. The underwriter exercised in full its option to purchase an additional 221,250 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $116.67 per share bringing the total shares issued from the offering to 1,696,250. The net proceeds from these issuances of common stock were $197.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility.Treasury SharesIn connection with our initial public offering in September 1995, our shareholders authorized our Management Board to repurchase up to 10% of our issued share capital, the maximum allowed under Dutch law at the time, for a period of 18 months. This authorization was renewed at subsequent annual or special shareholder meetings. At our annual shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2018, our shareholders authorized an extension to repurchase up to 10% of our issued share capital through November 24, 2019. The repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management pursuant to this shareholder authorization. From the activation of the share repurchase program on October 29, 2002 through December 31, 2018, pursuant to shareholder approvals, we have repurchased 39,618,299 shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion, or an average price of $41.57 per share and have canceled 33,475,406 shares with an historical cost of $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2018, we held 479,407 shares in treasury with the authority to repurchase 4,000,218 additional shares under our stock repurchase program. Subsequent to year-end, we have repurchased 35 shares at a total cost of $2.4 thousand.Dividend PolicyIn 2008, Core Laboratories announced the initiation of a cash dividend program. Cash dividends of $0.55 per share were paid each quarter of 2018 and 2017. The declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Supervisory Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, general financial condition, liquidity, capital requirements, and general business conditions. On January 15, 2019, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable February 15, 2019 to shareholders of record on January 25, 2019.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Amounts recognized, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2018 2017 consist of (in thousands):Unrecognized amounts currently recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that are expected to be recognized as components of next year's net pension benefit cost include $44.0 thousand of unrecognized net actuarial loss.F-2314. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We have granted restricted stock awards under two stock incentive plans: the 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2014 Nonemployee Director Stock Incentive Plan. Awards under the following three compensation programs have been granted pursuant to both plans: (1) the Performance Share Award Program ("PSAP"); (2) the Restricted Share Award Program ("RSAP") and (3) the Restricted Share Award Program for Nonemployee Directors (the "Program"). We issue shares from either treasury stock or authorized shares upon the lapsing of vesting restrictions on restricted stock. In 2018, we issued 218,625 shares out of treasury stock relating to the vesting of restricted stock. We do not use cash to settle equity instruments issued under stock-based compensation awards.2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan In 2014, the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan was amended, restated and renamed as the 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The primary changes effected by the 2014 amendment and restatement were to (a) extend the period during which awards may be granted under the Plan to May 12, 2024, and (b) increase the number of common shares subject to the Plan by 1,100,000 shares. The Plan, as amended, provides for a maximum of 11,900,000 common shares to be granted to eligible employees. At December 31, 2018, approximately 954,552 shares remained available for the grant of new awards under the Plan. Specifically, we encourage share ownership by awarding various long-term equity incentive awards under the Plan, consisting of the PSAP and RSAP. We believe that widespread common share ownership by key employees is an important means of encouraging superior performance and employee retention. Additionally, our equity-based compensation programs encourage performance and retention by providing additional incentives for executives to further our growth, development and financial success over a longer time horizon by personally benefiting through the ownership of our common shares and/or rights. Performance Share Award ProgramThe PSAP allows us to compensate our executive and senior management teams as we meet or exceed our business objectives. The PSAP shares are unvested and may not be sold, assigned, pledged, hedged, margined or otherwise transferred by an award recipient until such time as, and then only to the extent that, the restricted performance shares have vested. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the Plan) prior to the last day of the Performance Period, all of the award recipient's restricted performance shares will vest as of the effective date of such change in control. Subject to continued employment with us, or upon death or disability, PSAP shares vest if we meet or exceed our business objectives.The company recorded $9.9 million of additional non-cash stock compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 associated with the 2018 and 2017 PSAP awards for certain members of our executive management team. The additional stock compensation expense has been recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, "Compensation - Stock Compensation", which states that the period over which stock compensation expense is recognized should not extend beyond the eligible retirement age as defined in each executive's PSAP award agreement. The PSAP awards continue to remain unvested until such time as the performance criteria have been achieved for the designated performance period; however, the executive will not forfeit the right to vest in the awarded shares if they voluntarily retire from the Company after attaining the retirement age as defined in each agreement. Of this additional charge recognized in 2018, $7.9 million should have been recognized in 2017 when the executives reached the defined retirement age. We have concluded this amount is not material to our financial position or results of operations for either 2018 or 2017, and it does not impact our cash flows from operations. On February 16, 2016, certain executives were awarded rights to receive an aggregate of up to 122,515 common shares if our calculated return on investment capital ("ROIC"), as defined in the PSAP, achieved certain performance criteria as compared to the Bloomberg Comp Group at the end of the performance period, which ended on December 31, 2018 as the last trading day of 2018. This arrangement was recorded as an equity award that required us to recognize compensation expense totaling $11.7 million over the performance period that began on January 1, 2016, of which $3.9 million was recognized annually in 2018, 2017, and 2016. At December 31, 2018, the Company had the highest ROIC compared to the Bloomberg Comp Group. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Supervisory Directors verified that the performance target criteria had been met at the end of the performance period and 122,515 shares vested. We issued these common shares on December 31, 2018 and, simultaneously, the participants surrendered 38,351 common shares to settle any personal tax liabilities which may result from the award, as permitted by the agreement. We recorded these surrendered shares as treasury stock with an aggregate cost of $2.3 million at $59.66 per share.On February 14, 2017, certain executives were awarded rights to receive an aggregate of up to 128,112 common shares if our calculated ROIC, as defined in the PSAP, achieves certain performance criteria as compared to the Bloomberg Comp Group at F-24the end of the performance period, which ends on the last trading day of 2019, December 31, 2019. This arrangement is recorded as an equity award that requires us to recognize compensation expense totaling $14.2 million over the shorter of the 3-year performance period or requisite service period, as determined for each participant individually, of which $8.7 million and $4.7 million has been recognized annually in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over an estimated amortization period of 12 months. On February 13, 2018, certain executives were awarded rights to receive an aggregate of up to 162,772 common shares if our calculated ROIC, as defined in the PSAP, achieves certain performance criteria as compared to the Bloomberg Comp Group at the end of the performance period, which ends on the last trading day of 2020, December 31, 2020. This arrangement is recorded as an equity award that requires us to recognize compensation expense totaling $16.2 million over the shorter of the 3-year performance period or requisite service period, as determined for each participant individually, of which $11.4 million has been recognized in 2018. The unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over an estimated amortization period of 24 months.Restricted Share Award ProgramIn 2004, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Supervisory Directors approved the RSAP to attract and retain the best employees, and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. Under this arrangement we awarded grants totaling 115,618 shares, 101,811 shares, and 104,164 shares in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Each of these grants has a vesting period of principally six years and vests ratably on an annual basis. There are no performance accelerators for early vesting for these awards. Awards under the RSAP are classified as equity awards and recorded at the grant-date fair value with the compensation expense recognized over the expected life of the award. As of December 31, 2018, there was $27.2 million of unrecognized total stock-based compensation expense relating to non-vested RSAP awards. The unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 46 months. The grant-date fair value of shares granted was $11.6 million, $9.5 million and $10.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We recognized compensation expense of $8.9 million, $9.0 million and $10.5 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The total grant-date fair value, which is the intrinsic value, of the shares vested was $9.0 million, $9.6 million and $9.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 2014 Nonemployee Director Stock Incentive PlanOn May 13, 2014, the 2006 Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan was amended, restated and renamed as the 2014 Nonemployee Director Stock Incentive Plan (the "Director Plan"). The primary change effected by the 2014 amendment was to extend the period during which awards may be granted under the Director Plan to May 12, 2024. The Director Plan provides common shares for grant to our eligible Supervisory Directors. The maximum number of shares available for award under this plan is 1,400,000 common shares. As of December 31, 2018 approximately 537,086 shares remained available for issuance under the Director Plan. Only non-employee Supervisory Directors are eligible for these equity-based awards under the Director Plan. In 2011, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Supervisory Directors approved the restricted share award program (the "Program") to compensate our non-employee Supervisory Directors. Under this arrangement we awarded grants totaling 8,322 shares, 9,093 shares and 10,680 shares in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The shares awarded in 2018 and 2017 have a vesting period of one year for each grant; the shares awarded in 2016 have a vesting period of three years. There are no performance accelerators for early vesting for these awards. Awards under the Program are classified as equity awards and recorded at the grant-date fair value with compensation expense recognized over the expected life of the award. As of December 31, 2018, there was $0.3 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation relating to non-vested Program awards. The unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 3 months. The grant-date fair value of shares granted was $0.9 million, $1.0 million and $1.1 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and we have recognized compensation expense of $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $0.9 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.F-25Equity Compensation Plan InformationInformation about our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2018 are as follows: Stock-based Compensation Non-vested restricted share awards outstanding under both the Plan and the Director Plan as of December 31, 2018 and changes during the year were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, stock-based compensation expense under both the Plan and the Director Plan recognized in the income statement is as follows (in thousands):In 2018, we recorded additional stock compensation expenses of $9.9 million for retirement eligible employees as discussed in the section "Performance Share Award Program" above.15. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.Interest Rate RiskSeries A of our Senior Notes bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.01% and Series B bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.11%. Our Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus 1.375% to a maximum of LIBOR plus 2.00%. We are subject to interest rate risk on the debt in excess of $50 million drawn on our Credit Facility.In 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 1.73% through August 29, 2019, and under the second swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.50% through August 29, 2024. Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are highly effective. Unrealized losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in income as an increase or decrease to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense.F-26At December 31, 2018, we had fixed rate debt aggregating $200 million and variable rate debt aggregating $92 million, after taking into account the effect of the swaps.The fair values of outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in thousands):The fair value of all outstanding derivatives was determined using a model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data.The effect of the interest rate swaps on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in thousands):16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company's only financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis relate to certain aspects of the Company's benefit plans and our derivative instruments. We use the market approach to value certain assets and liabilities at fair value using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) with the assistance of a third party specialist. We do not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted prices in an active market (Level 1) or significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Gains and losses related to the fair value changes in the deferred compensation assets and liabilities are recorded in General and Administrative Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses related to the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income. The following table summarizes the fair value balances (in thousands):F-2717. OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET The components of other (income) expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands):Foreign Currency Risk We operate in a number of international areas which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We do not currently hold or issue forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes (a foreign exchange contract is an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate). Foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the USD against foreign currencies and are included in other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recognized foreign exchange losses in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency; as well as countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency. We recognized foreign exchange gains in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency and in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency. Foreign exchange gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the following table (in thousands): F-2818 . DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In the first quarter of 2018, in a continuing effort to streamline our business and align our business strategy for further integration of services and products, the Company committed to divest the business of our full range of permanent downhole monitoring systems and related services, which had been part of our Production Enhancement segment. We anticipate the sale of this business line will occur by the end of the first quarter of 2019.The associated results of operations are separately reported as Discontinued Operations for all periods presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Balance sheet items for this discontinued business, including an allocation of goodwill from the Production Enhancement segment, have been reclassified to Other current assets and Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Cash flows from this discontinued business are shown in the table below. As such, the results from continuing operations for the Company and segment highlights for Production Enhancement, exclude these discontinued operations.Selected data for this discontinued business for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following (in thousands):Selected data for this discontinued business at December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following (in thousands):F-29Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $0.2 million, $2.5 million and $(0.6) million, respectively.19. SEGMENT REPORTING We operate our business in two reporting segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields:  (1) Reservoir Description and (2) Production Enhancement. These business segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies.Results for these business segments are presented below. We use the same accounting policies to prepare our business segment results as are used to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements. All interest and other non-operating income (expense) is attributable to Corporate & Other area and is not allocated to specific business segments. Summarized financial information concerning our segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is shown in the following table (in thousands):F-30We are a Netherlands company and we derive our revenue from services and product sales to clients primarily in the oil and gas industry. No single client accounted for 10% or more of revenue in any of the periods presented.We attribute service revenue to the country in which the service was performed rather than where the reservoir or project is located while we attribute product sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of service revenue performed and recorded in the U.S. that are sourced from projects on non-U.S. oilfields. The following table shows a summary of our U.S. and non-U.S. operations for the years ended or at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):The following table shows the breakdown between services and product sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):F-3120.

Kentucky Bank is engaged in general full-service commercial and consumer banking.  A significant part of Kentucky Bank’s operating activities include originating loans, approximately 81% of which are secured by real estate at December 31, 2018.  Kentucky Bank makes commercial, agricultural and real estate loans to its commercial customers, with emphasis on small-to-medium-sized industrial, service and agricultural businesses.  It also makes residential mortgage, installment and other loans to its individual and other non-commercial customers.


 


Loan Rates:  Kentucky Bank offers variable and fixed rate loans.  Loan rates on variable rate loans generally adjust upward or downward based on changes in the loan’s index.  Rate adjustments on variable rate loans are made from 1 day to 5 years.  Variable rate loans may contain provisions that cap the amount of interest rate increases or decreases over the life of the loan.  In addition to the lifetime caps and floors on rate adjustments, loans secured by residential real estate may contain provisions that limit annual increases at a maximum of 200 basis points.  There is usually no annual limit applied to loans secured by commercial real estate.


 


Credit Risk:  Commercial lending and real estate construction lending, generally include a higher degree of credit risk than other loans, such as residential mortgage loans.  Commercial loans, like other loans, are evaluated at the time of approval to determine the adequacy of repayment sources and collateral requirements. Collateral requirements vary to some degree among borrowers and depend on the borrower’s financial strength, the terms and amount of the loan, and collateral available to secure the loan.  Credit risk results from the decreased ability or willingness to pay by a borrower.  Credit risk also results when a liquidation of collateral occurs and there is a shortfall in collateral value as compared to a loan’s outstanding balance.  For construction loans, inaccurate initial estimates of a project’s costs and the property’s completed value could weaken the Company’s position and lead to the property having a value that is insufficient to satisfy full payment of the amount of funds advanced for the property.  






 


Secured and unsecured consumer loans generally are made for automobiles, boats, and other motor vehicles.  In most cases, loans are restricted to Kentucky Bank’s general market area.


 


Other Products:  Kentucky Bank offers its customers a variety of other services, including checking, savings, money market accounts, certificates of deposits, safe deposit facilities, credit cards and other consumer-oriented financial services.  Kentucky Bank has Internet banking, including bill payment available to its customers at www.kybank.com.  Through its Wealth Management Department, Kentucky Bank provides brokerage services, annuities, life and long term care insurance, personal trust and agency services (including management agency services).


 


Competition and Market Served


 


Competition:  The banking business is highly competitive.  Competition arises from a number of sources, including other bank holding companies and commercial banks, consumer finance companies, thrift institutions, other financial institutions and financial intermediaries.  In addition to commercial banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions actively compete to provide a wide variety of banking services.  Mortgage banking firms, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies, financial affiliates of industrial companies and government agencies provide additional competition for loans and for many other financial services.  Kentucky Bank also currently competes for interest-bearing funds with a number of other financial intermediaries, including brokerage firms and mutual funds, which offer a diverse range of investment alternatives.  Some of the Company’s competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulatory review and restrictions that apply to the Company and its subsidiary bank.  In addition, the Company must compete with much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than the Company.


 


Market Served.  We primarily conduct our business in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Our primary market areas consist of Bourbon, Clark, Elliott, Fayette, Harrison, Jessamine, Madison, Rowan, Scott, Woodford and surrounding counties in Kentucky.  Per capita personal income for Kentucky during the third quarter increased from $40,682 in 2017 to $41,889 in 2018, according to data published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate in Kentucky was unchanged from 2017 to 2018. The unemployment rate in Kentucky was 4.4% for both December of 2018 and 2017.


 


Supervision and Regulation


 


Governing Regulatory Institutions:  As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve Board.  The Company’s subsidiary bank is subject to supervision and regulation by applicable state and federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions.  Kentucky Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered.  In addition to the impact of regulation, Kentucky Bank is affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.  The company also has a captive insurance subsidiary which is regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance.


 


Laws Protecting Deposits:  There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy.  These obligations and restrictions are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insured funds in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or is in default.  For example, under a policy of the Federal Reserve Board with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.  In addition, the “cross-guarantee” provisions of federal law require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default.


 


 


 






 


The federal banking agencies also have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions.  The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized”, as such terms are defined under uniform regulation defining such capital levels issued by each of the federal banking agencies.


 


Capital and Liquidity:  On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved final rules known as the “Basel III Capital Rules” substantially revising the risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions.  The Basel III Capital Rules address the components of capital and other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. Certain of the Basel III Capital Rules came into effect for the Company and Kentucky Bank on January 1, 2015; these rules are subject to a phase-in period which began on January 1, 2015.


 


Under the current rules, which were effective January 1, 2015, the Company is subject to additional capital requirements that include: (i) creation of a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, (ii) an increase to the minimum Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio, (iii) changes to risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, (iv) creation of an additional capital conservation buffer in excess of the required minimum capital ratios, and (v) changes to what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these capital requirements.


 


The Basel III Capital Rules were fully phased in effective January 1, 2019 and require banking organizations to maintain:


 






 


The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a “countercyclical capital buffer” that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and is not expected to have any current applicability to the Company or Kentucky Bank.


 


The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall.


 


The Basel III Capital Rules provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.  Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company and Kentucky Bank were given a one-time election (“Opt-out Election”) to filter certain accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) components, comparable to the treatment under the previous general risk-based capital rule. The Company and Kentucky Bank elected to choose the AOCI Opt-out Election.


 


Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and are being phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and is being phased-in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules revise the rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity. They establish a new framework under which mortgage-backed securities and other securitization exposures are subject to risk-weights ranging from 20% to 1,250%.






 


The rules also establish adjusted risk-weights for credit exposures, including multi-family and commercial real estate exposures that are 90 days or more past due or on non-accrual, are subject to a 150% risk-weight, except in situations where qualifying collateral and/or guarantees are in place. The existing treatment of residential mortgage exposures will remain subject to either a 50% risk-weight (for prudently underwritten owner-occupied first liens that are current or less than 90 days past due) or a 100% risk-weight (for all other residential mortgage exposures including 90 days or more past due exposures).  As shown in Note 19, the Company and Kentucky Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements, and management does not anticipate any adverse impact from the implementation of the new capital ratio.


 


Deposit Insurance:  The Company is subject to several deposit insurance assessments, which are described below:


 


FDIC Assessments.  The Company’s subsidiary bank is a member of the FDIC, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) up to the amount permitted by law.  The Company’s subsidiary bank is thus subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments.  The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank’s capital level and supervisory rating.


 


The assessment base must, with some possible exceptions, equal average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.  The FDIC has adopted a DIF restoration plan to ensure that the reserve ratio increases to 1.35% from 1.15% of insured deposits by 2020.  The assessment regulations (12 CFR Part 327) provide that after the reserve ratio reaches 1.38 percent (and provided that it remains at least 1.38 percent), the FDIC will automatically apply small bank (total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion) credits to reduce small banks’ regular deposit insurance assessments up to the full amounts of their assessments or the full amount of their credits, whichever is less.  Credits will be awarded to any bank, including any small bank affiliate of a large bank, that was a small bank at some point during the credit calculation period (i.e., credit accruing institution).  These credits are likely to start on the June 2019 invoice.


 


Financing Corporation (“FICO”) Assessments.  FICO assessment costs were $29 thousand in 2018, $49 thousand in 2017 and $50 thousand in 2016.  FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 possessing assessment powers in addition to the FDIC.  The FDIC acts as a collection agent for FICO, whose sole purpose is to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation.  Outstanding FICO bonds, which are 30-year noncallable bonds, mature in 2019.  Final FICO payments will occur in 2019.


 


Dodd-Frank Act:  On July 21, 2010, financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law.  The Dodd-Frank Act significantly restructured the financial regulatory environment in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous provisions that affect all bank holding companies and banks, including Kentucky Bancshares and Kentucky Bank, some of which are described in more detail below.  The scope and impact of many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions were determined and issued over time. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company has been substantial.  Provisions in the legislation that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and collection of interchange fees increased the costs associated with certain deposits and placed limitations on certain revenues those deposits generate.


 


Volcker Rule:  On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules that implement a part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.”  The Volcker Rule attempts to reduce risk and banking system instability by restricting U.S. banks from investing in or engaging in proprietary trading and speculation and imposing a strict framework to justify exemptions for underwriting, market making and hedging activities.  U.S. banks will be restricted from investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk.  The Volcker Rule has not had a significant effect on operations of the Company.  The roll-back of some Dodd-Frank provisions in 2018 included exempted smaller banks (under $10 billion in assets) from complying with the Volcker rule.


Consumer Regulations:  In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above, Kentucky Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks.  While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act, among others.  These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients when taking deposits or making loans.






 


These laws also limit Kentucky Bank’s ability to share information with affiliated and unaffiliated entities.  The bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing business operations.


Dividend Restrictions:  There are various legal and regulatory limits on the extent to which the Company’s subsidiary bank may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the Company.  In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies also have the authority to prevent a bank or bank holding company from paying a dividend or engaging in any other activity that, in the opinion of the agency, would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.  Dividends paid by the subsidiary bank have provided substantially all of the Company’s operating funds, and this may reasonably be expected to continue for the foreseeable future.


 


Employees


 


At December 31, 2018, the number of full time equivalent employees of the Company was 232.


 


Nature of Company’s Business


 


The business of the Company is not seasonal.  The Company’s business does not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have material adverse effect on the Company.No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any governmental entity.


 


Available Information


 


The Company files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


 


The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC on its website at www.sec.gov.  The Company’s website is located at www.kybank.com.


 


Item 1A.  Risk Factors


 


There are factors, many beyond our control, which may significantly affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations.  Some of these factors are described below in the sections titled financial risk, business risk and operational risk.  These risks are not totally independent of each other; some factors affect more than one type of risk.  These include regulatory, economic, and competitive environments.  


 


As part of the annual internal audit plan, our risk management department meets with management to assess these risks throughout the Company.  Many risks are further addressed in other sections of this Form 10-K document.  Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company’s business operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.


 


Industry Risk


 


Industry risk includes risks that affect the entire banking service industry.


 


Significant decline in general economic conditions will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.  Kentucky Bank serves both individuals and business customers throughout Central and Eastern Kentucky. The substantial majority of our loan portfolio is to individuals and businesses in these markets. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are affected by local and regional economic conditions. A downturn in these economies could have a negative impact on us and the ability of Kentucky Bank’s customers to repay their loans. The value of the collateral securing loans to borrowers may also decline as the economy declines. As a result, deteriorating economic conditions in these markets could cause a decline in the overall quality of our loan portfolio requiring us to charge-off a higher percentage of loans and/or increase our allowance for loan losses.






 


A decline in economic conditions in these markets may also force customers to utilize deposits held by Kentucky Bank in order to pay current expenses causing Kentucky Bank’s deposit base to shrink. 


As a result Kentucky Bank may have to borrow funds at higher rates in order to meet liquidity needs. These events may have a negative impact on our earnings and financial condition.


 


Significant declines in U.S. and global markets could have a negative impact on our earnings. The capital and credit markets could experience extreme disruption. These conditions result in less liquidity, greater volatility, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain asset types. In many cases, markets could exert downward pressure on stock prices, security prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. Sustained weakness in business and economic conditions in any or all of the domestic or foreign financial markets could result in credit deterioration in investment securities held by us, rating agency downgrades for such securities or other market factors that (such as lack of liquidity for re-sales, absence of reliable pricing information or unanticipated changes in the competitive market) could result in us having to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in the value of such investment securities, with a corresponding charge against earnings.  If the markets deteriorate further, these conditions may be material to our ability to access capital and may adversely impact results of operations. 


Further, Kentucky Bank’s trust and investment services income could be impacted by fluctuations in the securities market. A portion of this revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios. If the values of those investment portfolios decline, Kentucky Bank’s revenue could be negatively impacted. 


The exercise of regulatory power may have negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, rather than corporate shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth, among other things. These regulations also impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedure and controls. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. 


 


Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products that could be offered, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. 


Regulation of the Company and our subsidiaries is expected to continue to expand in scope and complexity in the future. These laws are expected to have the effect of increasing our costs of doing business and reducing our revenues, and may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act and other laws, as well as rules implementing or related to them, may adversely affect us. Specifically, any governmental or regulatory action having the effect of requiring us to obtain additional capital could reduce earnings and have a material dilutive effect on current shareholders, including the Dodd-Frank Act source of strength requirement that bank holding companies make capital infusions into a troubled subsidiary bank. Legislation and regulation of debit card fees, credit cards and other bank services, as well as changes in our practices relating to those and other bank services, may affect our revenue and other financial results. Additional information about increased regulation is provided in “Item 1. Business” under the heading “Supervision and Regulation.” 


We are also subject to tax laws and regulations promulgated by the United States government and the states in which it operates. Changes to these laws and regulations or the interpretations of such laws and regulations by taxing authorities could impact future tax expense and the value of deferred tax assets. 


 


 






 


A new accounting standard will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” Issued in June 2016, ASU 2016-13 adds Financial Accounting Standards Board “FASB” ASC Topic 326, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” and finalizes amendments to FASB ASC Subtopic 825-15, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses.” The amendments of ASU 2016-13 are intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information related to expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit by replacing the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit loss estimates.


 


The amendment requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to enhance their credit loss estimates.  The amendment requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization’s portfolio.  In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.  The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption will be permitted beginning after December 15, 2018.


 


As previously disclosed, the Company formed a cross functional committee to oversee the adoption of the ASU at the effective date.  A working group was also formed and has developed a project plan focused on understanding the ASU, researching issues, identifying data needs for modeling inputs, technology requirements, modeling considerations, and ensuring overarching governance has been achieved for each objective and milestone.  The project plan is targeting data and model validation completion during the first half of 2019, with parallel processing of our existing allowance for loan losses model with the CECL for 2 – 3 quarters prior to implementation, depending on how model completion and validation occurs. 


 


During 2019, the Company is focused on the completion of its model, refining assumptions, and continued review and challenge of the model.  Concurrent with this, the Company is also focused on researching and resolving interpretive accounting issues in the ASU, contemplating various related accounting policies, developing processes and related controls, and considering various reporting disclosures.


 


As of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, the Company expects to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment increasing the allowance for loan losses, if any, since the ASU covers credit losses over the expected life of a loan as well as considering future changes in macroeconomic conditions.  The magnitude of any such one-time adjustment or the overall impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements cannot yet be reasonably estimated , however, we expect to identify a range in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019.


 


In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations’ implementation of CECL.  The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard.


 


Deposit insurance premiums levied against the Company may increase if the number of bank failures increase or the cost of resolving failed banks increases.  The FDIC maintains a DIF to protect insured depositors in the event of bank failures. The DIF is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions including Kentucky Bank.  Future deposit premiums paid by Kentucky Bank depend on the level of the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures. Kentucky Bank may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums if market developments change such that the DIF balance is reduced.


 


Increased competition from other providers may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  We face vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions.  This competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services, reduce market share and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition.


Many other banks and financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits, larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services.  






 


Additionally, we encounter competition from both de novo and smaller community banks entering the markets we are currently in.  We also compete with other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies and insurance companies.


 


Changes in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our financial results.  Technology and other changes now allow many consumers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank and can access loans through lending groups and other non-regulated entities. This “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee and interest income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our operations, and we may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes that are accepted by new and existing customers.


 


Financial Risk


 


Financial risk components include, but are not limited to, credit risk, interest rate risk, goodwill impairment, market risk and liquidity risk.  We have adopted various policies to minimize potential adverse effects of interest rate, market and liquidity risks.  However, even with these policies in place, a change in interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations or financial position.


 


Defaults in the repayment of loans may negatively impact our business.  Credit risk is most closely associated with lending activities at financial institutions.  Credit risk is the risk to earnings and capital when a customer fails to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise fails to perform as agreed.  Credit risk arises from all activities where the Company is dependent on issuer, borrower, or counterparty performance, not just traditional lending activities.  For example, the investment security portfolio has inherent credit risk as do counterparties in derivative contracts.  Credit risk encompasses a broad range of financial institution activities and includes items reflected both on and off the balance sheet.


 


Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for repayment of many of the loans.  In determining the size of the allowance for loan losses, management considers, among other factors, the Company’s loan loss experience and an evaluation of economic conditions.  


If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, the current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio.  Material additions to the Company’s allowance would materially decrease our net income.


 


Fluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact our banking business.  Interest rate risk focuses on the impact to earnings and capital arising from movements in interest rates.  Interest rate risk focuses on the value implications for accrual portfolios (e.g., available-for-sale portfolios) and includes the potential impact to the Company’s accrual earnings as well as the economic perspective of the market value of portfolio equity.  The interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk.  Repricing risk represents the risk associated with the differences in timing of cash flows and rate changes with our products.  Basis risk represents the risk associated with changing rate relationships among varying yield curves.  Yield curve risk is associated with changing rate relationships over the maturity structure.  Options risk is associated with interest-related options, which are embedded in our products.


 


Changes in market multiples may negatively affect the value of Goodwill.  Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired.  Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.  Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually.  The Company has selected December 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test.  Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.  Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet.  At a minimum, management is required to assess goodwill and other intangible assets annually for impairment.  This assessment involves estimating cash flows for future periods, preparing analyses of market multiples for similar operations, and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is allocated.  






 


If these variables change negatively, the Company would be required to take a charge against earnings to write down the asset to the lower fair value.


 


Changes in market factors may negatively affect the value of our investment assets.  Market risk focuses on the impact to earnings and capital arising from changes in market factors (e.g., interest rates, market liquidity, volatilities, etc.) that affect the value of traded instruments.  Market risk includes items reflected both on and off the balance sheet.  Market risk focuses primarily on mark-to-market portfolios (e.g., accounts revalued for financial statement presentation).


 


Our inability to maintain appropriate levels of liquidity may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Liquidity risk focuses on the impact to earnings and capital resulting from our inability to meet our obligations as they become due in the normal course of business without incurring significant losses.  It also includes the management of unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources as well as managing changes in market conditions, which could affect the ability to liquidate assets in the normal course of business without incurring significant losses.  Liquidity risk includes items both on and off the balance sheet.


 


Our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected if we are unable to meet a debt covenant and, correspondingly, unable to obtain a waiver regarding the debt covenant from the lender.  From time to time we may obtain financing from other lenders.  The loan documents reflecting the financing often require us to meet various debt covenants.  If we are unable to meet one or more of our debt covenants, then we will typically attempt to obtain a waiver from the lender.  If the lender does not agree to a waiver, then we will be in default under our borrowing obligation.  This default could affect our ability to fund various strategies that we may have implemented resulting in a negative impact in our results of operations and financial condition.


We are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.  In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. While we will take steps to mitigate this risk, we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at one or more properties. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, while there are certain statutory protections afforded lenders who take title to property through foreclosure on a loan, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. 


Business Risk


 


Business risk is composed mainly of legal (compliance) risk, strategic risk and reputation risk.


 


Our results of operations and financial condition are susceptible to legal or compliance risks.  Legal or compliance risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from the impact of unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, adverse judgments, violations or nonconformance with laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards.  The risk also arises in situations where laws or rules governing certain products or activities of our customers may be ambiguous or untested.  This risk is not limited to the traditional thinking that legal/compliance risk is only associated with consumer protection laws.  It includes the exposure to litigation from all aspects of both traditional and nontraditional financial institution activities.


 


Incorrect strategic decisions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.


 


Adverse publicity may have a negative impact on our business.  Reputation risk is the risk to earnings and capital arising from negative public opinion.  This affects the ability to establish new relationships or services or to continue servicing existing relationships.  Examiners will assess reputation risk by recognizing the potential effect the public’s opinion could have on our franchise value.









 


The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may impact our business in unforeseen ways. On December 22, 2017, legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform”), was signed into law. The Tax Reform, among other changes, reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The enactment of the Tax Reform will significantly impact the manner in which we determine our federal income tax and may have unforeseen consequences. The Tax Reform is the first major overhaul of U.S. corporate taxation in almost 20 years with both positive and negative impacts on our business. The positive impacts include reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and accelerating the recovery period of the Company’s fixed assets. 


 


These positive impacts are offset by new tax provisions intended to expand the federal tax base by disallowing certain expenses that were previously deductible (i.e. 50% of entertainment expenses, deductions for certain senior management compensation, etc.). It is difficult to determine the overall impact on our business, but it appears that the Company will have a net savings in its federal income tax liability. 


 


The impact of the Tax Reform may also have significant impact on our clients and their future behavior in light of the new tax rates applicable to individuals, trusts and unincorporated businesses. The limitation on the deductibility of state and local taxes and real estate taxes for individuals may result in clients moving to lower tax states where we do not have operations


 


We are always seeking acquisition opportunities but the acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties and dilution to existing shareholder value.


 


We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future, and we may engage in de novo branch expansion.  We may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services.


 


We may incur substantial costs to expand, and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek.  There can be no assurance that integration efforts for any mergers or acquisitions will be successful.  Also, we may issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders.  There is no assurance that, following any mergers or acquisitions, our integration efforts will be successful or that, after giving effect to the acquisition, we will achieve profits comparable to, or better than, our historical experience.


 


We must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire a bank or bank holding company.  We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted.  We may be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval.


 


Future acquisitions could be material to Kentucky Bancshares and we may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests.


 


Operational Risk


 


Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.  Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster recovery.


This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.


 


In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.


 






 


Technology Risk


 


Systems failure, interruption or breach of security may have a negative impact on our business.  Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of Kentucky Bank’s business, as such systems are used to manage customer relationships, deposits, loans, general ledger accounts, financial reporting and regulatory compliance.  While Kentucky Bank has established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions, and security breaches, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do.  


 


In addition, any compromise of Kentucky Bank’s information security systems could deter customers from using Kentucky Bank’s web site and its internet banking service, both of which involve the transmission of confidential information.  


 


Although Kentucky Bank relies on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to ensure the secure transmission and processing of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from all compromises or breaches of security.


 


The business continuity of third-party providers may have a negative impact on our technology operations.  Kentucky Bank outsources certain of its data processing to third-party providers.  If third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if the Bank has difficulty communicating with them, Kentucky Bank’s ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and its business operations could be adversely impacted.  Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.


 


We and our subsidiary bank have addressed technology risks through the use of logon and user access controls, transaction limits, firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion protection monitoring and third party vulnerability scans.  Systems failure or interruption has been addressed by adopting a disaster recovery and contingency plan.  In addition, for all third-party providers of data processing services, we obtain and review audit reports prepared by independent registered public accounting firms regarding their financial condition and the effectiveness of their internal controls.

This section presents an analysis of the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kentucky Bank, at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2018.  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8.  When necessary, reclassifications have been made to prior years’ data throughout the following discussion and analysis for purposes of comparability with 2018 data.


 


Critical Accounting Policies


 


Overview.  The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiary are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry.  Significant accounting policies are listed in Note 1 of the Company’s 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8.  Critical accounting and reporting policies include accounting for loans and the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and fair value.  Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.


 


Loan Values and Allowance for Loan Losses.  Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by an allowance for loan losses.  Interest on loans is recognized on the accrual basis, except for those loans on the nonaccrual status.  Interest income received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method.  The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses.  Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors.  The accounting policies relating to the allowance for loan losses involve the use of estimates and require significant judgments to be made by management.  The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets.  Additional information related to the allowance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions “Asset Quality” and “Loan Losses” in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation, as well as Notes 1 and 4 of the Company’s 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes.


 


Goodwill.    Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually.  The Company has selected December 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test.  Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet.


 


Fair Values.  Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in the description of each asset and liability category in Note 17 of the Company’s 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes.  Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.  Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.


 


Forward-Looking Statements


 


This discussion contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties.  Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:  economic conditions (both generally and more specifically in the markets, including the tobacco market, the thoroughbred horse industry and the automobile industry relating to Toyota vehicles, in which the Company and its bank operate); competition for the Company’s customers from other providers of financial and mortgage services; government legislation, regulation and monetary policy (which changes from time to time and over which the Company has no control); changes in interest rates (both generally and more specifically mortgage interest rates); material unforeseen changes in the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company’s customers; 






 


and other risks detailed in Part 1, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this report and other risks detailed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company.  The Company undertakes no obligation to republish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.


 


Overview


 


We conduct our business through our one bank subsidiary, Kentucky Bank, and our one non-bank subsidiary KBI Insurance Company.  Kentucky Bank is engaged in general full-service commercial and consumer banking.  A significant part of Kentucky Bank’s operating activities include originating loans, approximately 83% of which are secured by real estate at December 31, 2018.  


 


Kentucky Bank makes commercial, agricultural and real estate loans to its commercial customers, with emphasis on small-to-medium-sized industrial, service and agricultural businesses.  It also makes residential mortgages, installment and other loans to its individual and other non-commercial customers.  Kentucky Bank’s primary market is Bourbon, Clark, Elliott, Fayette, Harrison, Jessamine, Madison, Rowan, Scott, Woodford and surrounding counties in Kentucky.  KBI Insurance Company is a captive insurance subsidiary and was incorporated in 2014.


 


Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $12.4 million, or $2.09 per common share compared to $10.7 million, or $1.81 for 2017 and $8.6 million, or $1.43 for 2016.  Earnings per share assuming dilution were $2.09, $1.81 and $1.43 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  For 2018, net income increased $1.7 million, or 16.0%.  Net interest income increased $2.2 million, provision for loan losses showed no change, total non-interest income decreased $845 thousand, while total other non-interest expense increased $1.1 million and income tax expense decreased $1.5 million.


 


For 2017, net income increased $2.1 million, or 25.1%.  Net interest income increased $1.5 million, the provision for loan losses decreased $650 thousand, total other income increased $1.7 million, while total other expenses decreased $712 thousand and income tax expense increased $2.4 million.


 


Return on average equity was 12.4% in 2018 compared to 10.9% in 2017 and 9.1% in 2016.  Return on average assets was 1.18% in 2018 compared to 1.04% in 2017 and 0.86% in 2016.


 


Non-performing loans as a percentage of loans (including held for sale) were 0.34%, 0.22% and 1.15% as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


 


For each share of common stock held as of close of business on December 3, 2019 we completed a two-for-one stock split.  Earnings and dividends per share have been adjusted in all periods presented to give effect to all stock splits and dividends through the date of issuance of the financial statements.


 


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


 


Net Interest Income


 


Net interest income, the Company’s largest source of revenue, on a tax equivalent basis increased from $34.0 million in 2016 to $35.4 million in 2017, and to $36.6 million in 2018.  The taxable equivalent adjustment (nontaxable interest income on state and municipal obligations net of the related non-deductible portion of interest expense) is based on our Federal income tax rate of 21% in 2018 and 34% in both 2017 and 2016.


 


Average earning assets increased and  average interest bearing liabilities decreased from 2017 to 2018.  Average earning assets increased $6.7 million, or 0.7%.  Average investment securities increased $2.1 million and average loans increased $17.9 million.  Average interest bearing liabilities decreased $2.7 million, or 0.4% during this same period.  Average interest-bearing deposits increased $6.2 million, or 1.1%,  average borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $2.9 million, or 3.0 %, and average repurchase agreements and other borrowings decreased $11.8 million, or 34.3%.  The Company continues to actively pursue quality loans and fund these primarily with deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  


 


The bank prime rates increased 100 basis points from December 2017 to December 2018.  The tax equivalent yield on earning assets increased from 4.11% in 2017 to 4.39% in 2018.






 


The volume rate analysis for 2018 that follows indicates that $910 thousand of the increase in interest income is attributable to an increase in volume, while the change in rates contributed to an increase of $3.1 million in interest income.  Further, a decrease in interest bearing liabilities resulted in a $514 thousand reduction interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 while changes in rates resulted in additional interest expense of $2.3 million over the same period.  The average rate of these liabilities increased from 0.70% in 2017 to 0.95% in 2018.  In summary, the increase in the Company’s 2018 net interest income is attributed mostly to increases in rates for interest earning assets and an increase in balances in our loan portfolio.


 


The volume rate analysis for 2017 that follows indicates that $985 thousand of the increase in interest income is attributable to an increase in volume, while the change in rates contributed to a decrease of $1.1 million in interest income.  Further, an increase in interest bearing liabilities resulted in $35 thousand additional interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 while changes in rates resulted in additional interest expense of $553 thousand over the same period.  The average rate of these liabilities increased from 0.64% in 2016 to 0.70% in 2017.  In summary, the increase in the Company’s 2017 net interest income is attributed mostly to increases in rates for interest earning assets and an increase in balances in our security portfolio. 


 


The accompanying analysis of changes in net interest income in the following table shows the relationships of the volume and rate portions of these changes in 2018 vs. 2017 and 2017 vs. 2016.  Changes in interest income and expenses due to both rate and volume are allocated on a pro rata basis.

Noninterest Income and Expenses


 


Noninterest income was $13.0 million in 2018, $13.8 million in 2017 and $12.1 million in 2016.  In 2018, reductions in gains on available for sale securities and gains on the sale of loans were offset by gains in service charges and debit card interchange income.  In 2017, reductions in gains on available for sale securities and gains on the sale of loans were offset by gains in service charges, loan servicing fee income, debit card interchange income and a one-time gain on the sale of a bank building.  In 2016, reductions in net loan servicing fee income, gains on available for sale securities and other income were offset by gains in service charges, gains on the sale of loans and debit card interchange income.


 


Securities gains (losses) were $(65) thousand in 2018, $52 thousand in 2017 and $287 thousand in 2016.  The gains are primarily attributed to selling securities which had gains in market value due to declining interest rates and the related inverse relationship of interest rates and market values.


 


Gains on loans sold were $1.6 million, $1.7 million and $2.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Loans held for sale are generally sold after closing to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or other government agencies.  During 2018, the loan servicing fee income, net of amortization expense for the mortgage servicing right asset, decreased $82 thousand, compared to an increase of $244 thousand in 2017.  In 2018, the mortgage servicing right asset had net recoveries of prior write-downs of $17 thousand compared to net recoveries of $69 thousand in the valuation allowance in 2017.  Proceeds from the sale of loans were $64 million, $58 million and $64 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The volume of loan originations is inverse to rate changes with historic low rates spurring activity.  The volume of loan originations during 2018 was $63 million, $57 million in 2017, and $62 million in 2016.


 


Other noninterest income, excluding net security gains (losses), the sale of mortgage loans and a one-time gain of $1.2 million for the sale of a building in 2017, was $11.5 million in 2018, $10.8 million in 2017 and $9.8 million in 2016.  Service charge income, and more particularly overdraft income, is the largest contributor to these numbers.  Overdraft income was $2.6 million in 2018, $2.6 million in 2017 and $2.7 million in 2016.  Debit card interchange income was the second largest contributor to noninterest income.  Debit card interchange income was $3.3 million in 2018, $3.0 million in 2017 and $2.7 million in 2016.  Other income was $430 thousand in 2018, $349 thousand in 2017 and $95 thousand in 2016.  


 


Noninterest expense increased $1.1 million in 2018 to $34.2 million, and decreased $712 thousand in 2017 to $33.1 million from $33.8 million in 2016.


 


Salaries and benefits, the largest contributor to total non-interest expense, increased $936 thousand from $18.0 million in 2017 to $18.9 million in 2018 due to normal staff merit increases.  Full-time equivalent employees decreased from 233 at December 31, 2017 to 232 at December 31, 2018.


 


The largest component of occupancy expense, depreciation expense, increased $39 thousand to $1.2 million in 2018, and decreased $104 thousand to $1.2 million in 2017.  Building rent expense, included in occupancy expense, increased $10 thousand from 2017 to 2018, mostly due to additional space leased at the Lexington Vine branch.  


 


Other noninterest expenses decreased from $12.1 million in 2016 to $11.3 million in 2017 and was unchanged at $11.3 million in 2018.   Legal and professional fees decreased $174 thousand from $1.1 million in 2017 to $908 thousand in 2018.  Legal and professional fees were higher in 2017 due to additional costs related to utilizing additional outside consulting services.  Amortization expense of core deposits was $130 thousand in 2018, $160 thousand in 2017 and $247 thousand in 2016.  See Note 7 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 for more detail of the goodwill and intangible assets.


 






 


The following table is a summary of noninterest income and expense for the three-year period indicated.


 



 


Income Taxes


 


As part of normal business, Kentucky Bank typically makes tax free loans to select municipalities in our market and invests in selected tax free securities, primarily in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  In making these investments, the Company considers the overall impact to managing our net interest margin, credit worthiness of the underlying issuer and the favorable impact on our tax position.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company averaged $60.1 million in tax free securities, and $38.2 million in tax free loans.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company averaged $81.1 million in tax free securities, $2.5 million in tax free trading assets and $39.3 million in tax free loans.  As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average remaining maturity for the tax free securities is 115 months, while the weighted average remaining maturity for the tax free loans is 149 months.


 


The Company had income tax expense of $1.7 million in 2018, $3.2 million in 2017 and $773 thousand in 2016.  This represents an effective income tax rate of 11.7% in 2018, 22.8% in 2017 and 8.3% in 2016.  The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate of 21% in 2018 and 34% in both 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to tax exempt income on certain investment securities and loans.  On December 22, 2017, the ‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’ was enacted into legislation. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws were recognized in the period in which the new legislation was enacted. Accordingly,in 2017, the Company recorded an estimated $443 thousand for the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets to estimate the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the lowering of the federal corporate tax rate to 21%. 


 


In addition, the Company had additional tax credits which also contributed to the lower effective income tax rates.  For both  2018 and 2017, the Company had tax credits totaling $555 thousand for investments made in affordable housing project investments. 


 


Balance Sheet Review


 


Assets remained steady at $1.1 billion from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.  Securities available for sale decreased $2.8 million during 2018, outstanding loan balances increased $37.6 million during 2018 and deposits increased $35.2 million during 2018.  Assets at year-end 2017 totaled $1.1 billion compared to $1.0 million in 2016.  Securities available for sale increased $44 million, outstanding loan balances decreased $7.5 million and deposits increased $12 million compared to 2016. 






 


Loans


 


Total loans (including loans held for sale) were $687 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $650 million at December 31, 2017 and $657 million at December 31, 2016.  As of December 31, 2018 and compared to the prior year-end, commercial loans increased $6.1 million, real estate construction loans increased $3.4 million, 1-4 family residential property loans increased $14.2 million, multi-family residential property loans increased $6.5 million, non-farm & non-residential property loans increased $4.6 million, agricultural loans increased $873 thousand and consumer loans and other loans increased $1.9 million.  


 


As of December 31, 2017 and compared to the prior year-end, commercial loans increased $2.6 million, real estate construction loans decreased $8.4 million, 1-4 family residential property loans decreased $6.0 million, multi-family residential property loans decreased $7.3 million, non-farm & non-residential property loans increased $16.1 million, agricultural loans decreased $3.3 million and consumer loans and other loans decreased $698 thousand.  


 


As of both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the real estate mortgage portfolio comprised 83% and 81% of total loans, respectively  The real estate mortage portfolio is comprised of real estate construction, 1-4 family residential, multi-family residential, non-farm and non-residential and agricultural loans.


 


1-4 family residential represented 37% of the total loan portfolio as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017.  Real estate constructions loans accounted for 4% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 3% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017.  Multi-family loans represented 7% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 6% as of December 31, 2017    Non-farm and non-residential loans totaled 29% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 30% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017.


 


Agricultural loans comprised 9% of the total loan portfolio at both December 31, 2018 and at December 31, 2017. Approximately 87% of the agricultural loans are secured by real estate at December 31, 2018 and 88% at December 31, 2017.  The remainder of the agricultural portfolio is used to purchase livestock, equipment and other capital improvements and for general operation of the farm.  Generally, a secured interest is obtained in the capital assets, equipment, livestock or crops.


 


Automobile loans account for 16%, in 2018 and 18% in 2017, of the consumer loan portfolio, while the purpose of the remainder of this portfolio is used by customers for purchasing retail goods, home improvement or other personal reasons.  The commercial loan portfolio is mainly for capital outlays and business operation.


 


Collateral is requested depending on the creditworthiness of the borrower.  Unsecured loans are made to individuals or companies mainly based on the creditworthiness of the customer.  Approximately 8% of the loan portfolio is unsecured.  Management is not aware of any significant concentrations that may cause future material risks, which may result in significant problems with future income and capital requirements.


 






 


The following table represents a summary of the Company’s loan portfolio by category for each of the last five years.  There is no concentration of loans (greater than 5% of the loan portfolio) in any industry.  The Company has no foreign loans or highly leveraged transactions in its loan portfolio.


 



 


The following table sets forth the maturity distribution and interest sensitivity of selected loan categories at December 31, 2018.  Maturities are based upon contractual term.  The total loans in this report represent loans net of deferred loan fees, including loans held for sale but excluding the allowance for loan losses.  In addition, deferred loan fees on the above table are netted with real estate mortgage loans on the following table.


 



 


Mortgage Banking


 


The Company has been in mortgage banking since the early 1980’s.  The activity in origination and sale of these loans fluctuates, mainly due to changes in interest rates.  Mortgage loan originations decreased from $62 million in 2016 to $57 million in 2017, and increased to $63 million in 2018.  Proceeds from the sale of loans were $64 million, $58 million and $64 million for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.  


Mortgage loans held for sale were $1.2 million at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  Fixed rate residential mortgage loans are generally sold when they are made.  The volume of loan originations is inverse to rate changes. 


 


During 2018, rising mortgage rates and fewer consumers refinancing mortgages resulted in the Bank originating fewer mortgage loans when compared to 2017.  The effect of these changes was also reflected on the income statement.  As a result, the gain on sale of loans was $1.6 million in 2018 compared to $1.7 million in 2017 and $2.1 million in 2016.


 






 


The Bank has sold various loans to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) while retaining the servicing rights.  Gains and losses on loan sales are recorded at the time of the cash sale, which represents the premium or discount paid by the FHLMC and FHLB.  The Bank receives a servicing fee from the FHLMC and FHLB on each loan sold.  Servicing rights are carried using the amortized cost method and are capitalized based on the relative fair value of the rights and the expected life of the loan and are expensed in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues.


 


Mortgage servicing rights were $1.5 million at December 31, 2018, $1.5 million at December 31, 2017 and $1.3 million at December 31, 2016.


 


Amortization of mortgage servicing rights was $310 thousand (including $17 thousand for positive fair value adjustments), $246 thousand (including $69 thousand for positive fair value adjustments) and $439 thousand (including $105 thousand for negative fair value adjustments) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  See Note 4 in the Company’s 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 for additional information.


 


Deposits


 


For 2018, total deposits increased $35.2 million to $850.4 million.  Noninterest bearing deposits increased $1.2 million, time deposits of $250 thousand and over decreased $19.8 million, and other interest bearing deposits increased $53.8 million.  Public fund balances totaled $207 million at December 31, 2018, of which $205 million was interest bearing.  


 


For 2017, total deposits increased $12 million to $815 million.  Noninterest bearing deposits increased $11 million, time deposits of $250 thousand and over increased $5 million, and other interest bearing deposits decreased $4 million.  Public fund balances totaled $192 million at December 31, 2017, of which $187 million was interest bearing.


 


The table below provides information on the maturities of time deposits of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2018:


 



 


Borrowings


 


The Company utilizes both long-term and short-term borrowings.  Long-term borrowing at the Bank is primarily from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB).  This borrowing is mainly used to fund longer term, fixed rate mortgages, as part of a leverage strategy and to assist in asset/liability management.  Advances are either paid monthly or at maturity.  As of December 31, 2018, $100.5 million was borrowed from FHLB, an increase of $1.7 million from December 31, 2017.  


 


Throughout 2018, the Bank had a net increase of $3.2 million in short-term borrowings from the FHLB which were outstanding at December 31, 2018.  As of December 31, 2017, $8.4 million in short-term borrowings from the FHLB were outstanding.  FHLB advances classified as short-term have an original maturity of less than 1 year.  


Also, during 2018, the Bank borrowed $16.4 million in long-term advances and repaid $17.9 million in long term advances.  These advances each had an original maturity of more than 1 year.


 


Throughout 2017, the Bank had a net increase of $8.4 million in short-term borrowings from the FHLB which were outstanding at December 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2016, no short-term borrowings from the FHLB were outstanding.  During 2017, the Bank borrowed $13.0 million in longer-term advances and repaid $15.2 million in long term advances.  Those advances each had an original maturity of more than 1 year.


 


On July 20, 2015, the Company borrowed $5.0 million which had an outstanding balance of $2.7 million at December 31, 2018.  The term loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.0%, requires quarterly principal and interest payments, matures July 20, 2025 and is collateralized by Kentucky Bank stock.  Additional information pertaining to the note payable may be found in Note 10 of the financial statements.






 


The following table depicts relevant information concerning our short term borrowings.


 



 


Contractual Obligations


 


The Bank has required future payments for time deposits and long-term debt.  The other required payments are the approximate future minimum lease payments due under the aforementioned operating leases for their base term and are as follows:



 


Asset Quality


 


With respect to asset quality, management considers three categories of assets to merit close scrutiny.  These categories include:  loans that are currently nonperforming, other real estate, and loans that are currently performing but which management believes require special attention.


 


During periods of economic slowdown, the Company may experience an increase in nonperforming loans.


 


The Company discontinues the accrual of interest on loans that become 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless reasons for delinquency are documented such as the loan being well collateralized and in the process of collection.  A loan remains in a non-accrual status until factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist.  A loan is classified as a restructured loan when the interest rate is materially reduced or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date because of the inability of the borrower to service the interest payments at market rates.  Other real estate is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell.  






 


A summary of the components of nonperforming assets, including several ratios using period-end data, is shown as follows.


 





 


Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018 were $3.2 million compared to $3.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $9.4 million at December 31, 2016.  The decrease from 2017 to 2018 is mostly attributed to decreases in other real estate.  The decrease from 2016 to 2017 is attributed to decreases in non-accrual loan balances and restructured loans.  Total other real estate properties totaled $830 thousand at December 31, 2018, of which, $464 thousand were income producing property.  Total nonperforming loans were $2.3 million, $1.4 million, and $7.6 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The decrease in restructured loans during 2017 is attributed to restructured loans with a balance at December 31, 2016 paying off during 2017.  No restructured notes were held in 2018.  Total net loan charge offs in 2018 were $93 thousand.  The amount of lost interest on our non-accrual loans was $108 thousand for 2018 and $46 thousand for 2017.  At December 31, 2018, loans currently performing but which management believes requires special attention were $16.5 million, with 48% being non-farm and non-residential, 23% being agriculturual, 16% being 1-4 family residential, 7% being multi-family and 6% being commercial.  The Company continues to follow its long-standing policy of not engaging in international lending and not concentrating lending activity in any one industry.


 


The carrying amount of impaired loans as of December 31, 2018 was $993 thousand compared to $183 thousand as of December 31, 2017.  These amounts are generally included in the total nonperforming and restructured loans presented in the table above.  See Note 17 in the Company’s 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 herein.


 


A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  All amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest payments and the contractual principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement.


 


Nonaccrual loans are loans for which payments in full of principal or interest is not expected or which principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection.  Impaired loans may be loans showing signs of weakness or interruptions in cash flow, but ultimately are current or less than 90 days past due with respect to principal and interest and for which we anticipate full payment of principal and interest through collateral liquidation.


 


Additional factors considered by management in determining impairment and non-accrual status include payment status, collateral value, availability of current financial information, and the probability of collecting all contractual principal and interest payments.  


 


At December 31, 2018, loans individually evaluated for impairment totaled $4.9 million.  Of this, $201 thousand in balances had specific impairment allocations of $201 thousand.  The remaining $4.7 million in impaired loan balances did not have a specific impairment allocation.  


 


At December 31, 2017, impaired loan balances of $206 thousand had specific impairment allocations of $23 thousand.  An additional $1.4 million in loan balances were individually reviewed for impairment but resulted in no specific impairment allocation.  






 


The allowance for loan losses on impaired loans is determined using one of two methods.  Either the present value of estimated future cash flows of the loan, discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral.  The entire change in present value of expected cash flows is reported as a provision for loan losses in the same manner in which impairment initially was recognized or as a reduction in the amount of provision for loan losses that otherwise would be reported.  The total allowance for loan losses related to these loans was $201 thousand, $23 thousand and $541 thousand on December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


 


Kentucky Bank has a “Problem Loan Committee” that meets at least quarterly to review problem loans, including past due and non-performing loans, and other real estate.  When analyzing the problem loans and the loan quality as of December 31, 2018, the following factors have been considered:


 











 






 


Loan Losses


 


The following table is a summary of the Company’s loan loss experience for each of the past five years.


 





 


Loans are typically charged-off when the collection of principal is considered doubtful, and would be well documented and approved by the appropriate responsible party or committee.  The provision for loan losses for 2018 was $500 thousand compared to $500 thousand in 2017 and $1.2 million in 2016.  Net charge-offs were $93 thousand in 2018, $321 thousand in 2017 and $130 thousand in 2016.  Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.02% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The provision for loan losses remained at $500 thousand from 2017 to 2018 and decreased $600 thousand from 2016 to 2017.  The allowance for loan losses increased $407 thousand from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.


 


In evaluating the allowance for loan losses, management considers the composition of the loan portfolio, the historical loan loss experience, the overall quality of the loans and an assessment of current economic conditions.  


At December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses was 1.18% of loans outstanding compared to 1.19% at year-end 2017 and 1.15% at year-end 2016.  Management believes the allowance for loan losses at the year-end 2018 is adequate to cover probable incurred credit losses within the portfolio.


 






 


The following tables set forth an allocation for the allowance for loan losses and loans by category.  In making the allocation, management evaluates the risk in each category, current economic conditions and charge-off experience.  An allocation for the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the portion of the allowance that represents probable incurred losses in each loan category, but it does not preclude any portion of the allowance allocated to one type of loan being used to absorb losses of another loan type.


 



 





 


Off-balance Sheet Arrangements


 


Some financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs.  These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates.  Commitments may expire without being used.  Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated.  The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment.


 


Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk were as follows at year-end (in thousands):


 



 


Unused lines of credit are substantially all at variable rates.  Commitments to make loans are generally made for a period of 60 days or less and are primarily fixed at current market rates ranging from 3.88% to 6.50% with maturities ranging up to 30 years.


 






 


Capital


 


As displayed by the following table, the Company’s Tier I capital (as defined by the Federal Reserve Board under the Board’s risk-based guidelines) at December 31, 2018 increased $9.0 million to $103.1 million from December 31, 2017.  Stockholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, was $110.3 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $101.3 million at December 31, 2017.  Included in Tier I capital is $7 million of trust preferred securities issued in August 2003.  The disallowed amount of stockholders’ equity is mainly attributable to the goodwill and/or core deposit intangibles, resulting from the Kentucky First acquisition in 2003, the Peoples Bank acquisition in 2006 and the Madison Financial Corporation acquisition in 2015.  The Company’s risk-based capital and leverage ratios, as shown in the following table, exceeded the levels required to be considered “well capitalized”.  The leverage ratio compares Tier I capital to total average assets less disallowed amounts of goodwill.


 





 


The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) established five capital categories for insured depository institutions under its Prompt Corrective Action Provisions.  The bank regulatory agencies adopted regulations, which became effective in 1992, defining these five capital categories for banks they regulate.  The categories vary from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized”.  


 


A “well capitalized” bank is defined as one with a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, a leverage ratio of 5% or more, and one not subject to any order, written agreement, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet or maintain a specific capital level.  At December 31, 2018, the bank had ratios that exceeded the minimum requirements established for the “well capitalized” category.






 


In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that will revise their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method of calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.


 


The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirement unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised. The rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and will end January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective.


 


In management’s opinion, there are no other known trends, events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources or operations.

Securities, classified as available for sale, decreased from $318.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $315.4 million at December 31, 2018.   Federal funds sold totaled $266 thousand at December 31, 2018 and $321 thousand at December 31, 2017.  


 


Per Company policy, fixed rate asset backed securities will not have an average life exceeding seven years, but final maturity may be longer.  Adjustable rate securities shall adjust within three years per Company policy.  As of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company held $11 million in adjustable-rate mortgage backed securities.  Unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities are temporary and change inversely with movements in interest rates.  In addition, some prepayment risk exists on mortgage-backed securities and prepayments are likely to increase with decreases in interest rates.  The following tables present the investment securities for each of the past three years and the maturity and yield characteristics of securities as of December 31, 2018.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices


 


The majority of the Company’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature.  Therefore, the Company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets and inventories.  However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio.  Inflation also affects other expenses, which tend to rise during periods of inflation.


 


Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk


 


Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.  Management considers interest rate risk and liquidity risk to be significant market risks to the Company, but considers interest risk to be the most significant.


 


Kentucky Bank’s Asset/Liability Committee oversees the Company’s interest rate risk and liquidity risks.  The Bank has developed procedures designed to ensure safety and soundness, maintain liquidity and regulatory capital standards, and achieve acceptable net interest income.  The exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Asset/Liability Committee.


 


Interest Rate Risk.  Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes.  These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values.  The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximize income.


 


Management realizes certain risks are inherent and that the goal is to identify and minimize the risks.  The primary tool used by management is an interest rate shock simulation model.


 


Certain assumptions, such as prepayment risks, are included in the model.  However, actual prepayments may differ from those assumptions.  In addition, immediate withdrawal of interest checking and other savings accounts may have an effect on the results of the model.  


 


The following table depicts the change in net interest income resulting from 100 and 300 basis point changes in rates.  The projections are based on balance sheet growth assumptions and repricing opportunities for new, maturing and adjustable rate amounts.  In addition, the projected percentage changes from level rates are outlined below along with the Board of Directors approved limits.  As of December 31, 2018 the projected net interest income percentages are within the Board of Directors limits.  Please note that in the current low interest rate environment, many rates cannot decline 100 basis points.  






 


Therefore, the projected net interest income changes below as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 for a declining rate environment are not as relevant.  The projected net interest income report summarizing the Company’s interest rate sensitivity as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:


 


Projected Net Interest Income (December 31, 2018)


 



 


Projected Net Interest Income (December 31, 2017)


 



 


The numbers in 2018 are comparable to 2017.  In 2018, year one reflected a 1.3% decrease in projected net interest income compared to a 0.3% projected increase in 2017 with a 100 basis point increase.  The 300 basis point increase in rates reflected a 5.5% decrease in net interest income in 2018 and a 0.4% increase in 2017.  The 100 point decrease in rates reflected a 5.8% decrease in net interest income in 2018 compared to a 2.4% decrease in 2017.


 


Management measures the Company’s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in net interest income in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates.  The Company’s exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and quarterly with the Board of Directors.


 


Exposure to interest rate risk is measured with the use of interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates, while interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the Company’s assets and liabilities.  If estimated changes to net interest income are not within the limits established by the Board, the Board may direct management to adjust the Company’s asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within Board approved limits.


 


Liquidity Risk.  Liquidity risk is the possibility that the Company may not be able to meet its cash requirements.  Management of liquidity risk includes maintenance of adequate cash and sources of cash to fund operations and meet the needs of borrowers, depositors and creditors.  Excess liquidity generally has a negative impact on earnings resulting from the lower yields on short-term assets.


 


In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the securities portfolio provides an important source of liquidity.  Total securities maturing within one year along with cash and cash equivalents totaled $26.1 million at December 31, 2018.  Additionally, securities available-for-sale with maturities greater than one year and mortgage-backed and equity securities totaled $315.4 million at December 31, 2018.  The available for sale securities are available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis.  


 


The Company maintains a relatively stable base of customer deposits and its steady growth is expected to be adequate to meet its funding demands.  In addition, management believes the majority of its $100,000 or more certificates of deposit are no more volatile than its core deposits.  At December 31, 2018 these balances totaled $109.8 million, approximately 13% of total deposits.


 


The Company also relies on Federal Home Loan Bank advances for both liquidity and asset/liability management purposes.  These advances are used primarily to fund long-term fixed rate residential mortgage loans.  We have sufficient collateral to borrow an additional $75 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank at December 31, 2018.  In addition, as of December 31, 2018, $38 million is available in overnight borrowing through various correspondent banks and the Company has access to an additional $302 million in brokered deposits.






 


 


Generally, the Company relies upon net cash inflows from financing activities, supplemented by net cash inflows from operating activities, to provide cash used in its investing activities.  As is typical of many financial institutions, significant financing activities include deposit gathering, and the use of short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements along with long-term debt.  The Company’s primary investing activities include purchasing investment securities and loan originations.  Management believes there is sufficient cash flow from operations to meet investing and liquidity needs related to reasonable borrower, depositor and creditor needs in the present economic environment.


 


The cash flow statements for the periods presented provide an indication of the Company’s sources and uses of cash as well as an indication of the ability of the Company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.


 


A number of other techniques are used to measure the liquidity position, including the ratios presented below.  These ratios are calculated based on annual averages for each year.
